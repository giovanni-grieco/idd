  "content": "Distributed ledger technology law (\"DLT law\") (also called blockchain law, Lex Cryptographia or algorithmic legal orderThe algorithmic legal order (Retrieved on March 20th 2020). Original Spanish peer-reviewed article: ) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment. == Analogy with the Law of the Horse and Legal aspects of computing|Law of cyberspace debate == Ubiquitous dissemination of information technology and the Internet led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of cyberspace. According to The Law of the Horse theory proposed by Frank H. Easterbrook, general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each. This theory was challenged by Lawrence Lessig, who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law \"characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations\". == Areas of law == As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of cryptocurrency and regulation of initial coin offering, use of smart contracts, status of DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and other. == Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts == While in the UK and the EU at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the United States several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts. ===Vermont === On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as \"mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise\"https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf ===Arizona === In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.” HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless” and definition of smart contract as \"event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger\". The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11. === Nevada === In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada. In addition, Nevada was the first state to ban local governments from taxing the use of \"blockchain\". With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as \"an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information\".https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf === Delaware === On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders. \"Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty.\" ===Illinois=== On January 31, 2018, Illinois regarded its role in the development of the blockchain ecosystem as one which \"supports the distinct needs of the respective ecosystem stakeholders: entrepreneurs, capital providers, developers, governments, and academics to support and encourage the creation and growth of 15 blockchain companies in Illinois.\" To accomplish this mission the Illinois Blockchain Initiative created the role of the State of Illinois Blockchain Business Liaison, which is responsible for the engagement of these stakeholders within the ecosystem to identify and conclusively work to resolve their respective needs. Over the past year, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has compiled a database of over 200 blockchain and distributed ledger technology pilots, projects and strategies announced by public sector entities. The database is an overview of how government at various levels globally 29 are employing blockchain technology in their efforts to govern, improve the competitiveness of their economy and also deliver high-quality services in a more efficient manner. The public sector is one of the most active blockchain sector’s exploring the technology for a wide variety of use cases. Adoption of the technology in the public section is accelerating at an extraordinary pace. == DLT and law issues == === Issue of situs and place for dispute resolution === In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts. International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. \"However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be.\" Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. \"Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes.\"Eliza Mik, ‘Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity” (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269. In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177. \"Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution.\" === Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT === An absence of legal compliance mechanism on DLT, self-executing nature of code on DLT and limited ability to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several possible solutions of addressing these issues. \"One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and application programming interface (API) of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database.\"Max Raskin, ‘The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts’ (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305. On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by Alexander Savelyev: \"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority. (2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‘offline’ mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims.\"Alexander Savelyev, 'Contract law 2.0: ‘Smart’ contracts as the beginning of the end of classic contract law' (2017) Information \u0026 Communications Technology Law Vol 26 No 2, 116. === Issue of automation of smart contracts and 'Oracles' === To facilitate the self-execution, a smart contract needs access to sources of event information through which the execution of its terms and conditions is assessed. \"In the interest rate swap example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information.\"Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt, 'Smart contracts: A smart way to automate performance' (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 417. The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on Ethereum blockchain or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by Corda distributed ledger.https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf The solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external party (or a machine) providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met. \"Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly.\" == References == Category:Law by issue Category:Blockchain entities Category:Government by algorithm ",

  "content": "In finance, interest rate immunisation, as developed by Frank Redington is a strategy that ensures that a change in interest rates will not affect the value of a portfolio. Similarly, immunisation can be used to ensure that the value of a pension fund's or a firm's assets will increase or decrease in exactly the opposite amount of their liabilities, thus leaving the value of the pension fund's surplus or firm's equity unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate. Interest rate immunisation can be accomplished by several methods, including cash flow matching, duration matching, and volatility and convexity matching. It can also be accomplished by trading in bond forwards, futures, or options. Other types of financial risks, such as foreign exchange risk or stock market risk, can be immunised using similar strategies. If the immunisation is incomplete, these strategies are usually called hedging. If the immunisation is complete, these strategies are usually called arbitrage. ==Cash flow matching== Conceptually, the easiest form of immunisation is cash flow matching. For example, if a financial company is obliged to pay 100 dollars to someone in 10 years, it can protect itself by buying and holding a 10-year, zero-coupon bond that matures in 10 years and has a redemption value of $100. Thus, the firm's expected cash inflows would exactly match its expected cash outflows, and a change in interest rates would not affect the firm's ability to pay its obligations. Nevertheless, a firm with many expected cash flows can find that cash flow matching can be difficult or expensive to achieve in practice. That meant that only institutional investors could afford it. But the latest advances in technology have relieved much of this difficulty. Dedicated portfolio theory is based on cash flow matching and is being used by personal financial advisors to construct retirement portfolios for private individuals. Withdrawals from the portfolio to pay living expenses represent the stream of expected future cash flows to be matched. Individual bonds with staggered maturities are purchased whose coupon interest payments and redemptions supply the cash flows to meet the withdrawals of the retirees. ==Duration matching== A more practical alternative immunisation method is duration matching. Here, the duration of the assets is matched with the duration of the liabilities. To make the match actually profitable under changing interest rates, the assets and liabilities are arranged so that the total convexity of the assets exceed the convexity of the liabilities. In other words, one can match the first derivatives (with respect to interest rate) of the price functions of the assets and liabilities and make sure that the second derivative of the asset price function is set to be greater than or equal to the second derivative of the liability price function. == Calculating immunisation == Immunisation starts with the assumption that the yield curve is flat. It then assumes that interest rate changes are parallel shifts up or down in that yield curve. Let the net cash flow at time t be denoted by R_t, i.e.: : R_t = A_t - L_t \\text{ for } t = 1,2,3,\\ldots,n where A_t and L_t represent cash inflows and outflows or liabilities respectively. Assuming that the present value of cash inflows from the assets is equal to the present value of the cash outflows from the liabilities, then: : P(i) = 0 The Theory of Interest, Stephen G. Kellison, McGraw Hill International,2009 ==Immunisation in practice== Immunisation can be done in a portfolio of a single asset type, such as government bonds, by creating long and short positions along the yield curve. It is usually possible to immunize a portfolio against the most prevalent risk factors. A principal component analysis of changes along the U.S. Government Treasury yield curve reveals that more than 90% of the yield curve shifts are parallel shifts, followed by a smaller percentage of slope shifts and a very small percentage of curvature shifts. Using that knowledge, an immunized portfolio can be created by creating long positions with durations at the long and short end of the curve, and a matching short position with a duration in the middle of the curve. These positions protect against parallel shifts and slope changes, in exchange for exposure to curvature changes. ==Difficulties== Immunisation, if possible and complete, can protect against term mismatch but not against other kinds of financial risk such as default by the borrower (i.e., the issuer of a bond). It might also be difficult to find assets with suitable cashflow structures that are necessary to ensure a particular level of overall volatility of assets to have a proper match with that of liabilities. Once there is a change in interest rate, the entire portfolio has to be restructured to immunise it again. Such a process of continuous restructuring of portfolios makes immunisation a costly and tedious task. Users of this technique include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and bond brokers; individual investors infrequently have the resources to properly immunise their portfolios. The disadvantage associated with duration matching is that it assumes the durations of assets and liabilities remain unchanged, which is rarely the case. ==History== Immunisation was discovered independently by several researchers in the early 1940s and 1950s. This work was largely ignored before being re-introduced in the early 1970s, whereafter it gained popularity. See Dedicated Portfolio Theory#History for details. ==See also== *Arbitrage *Asset–liability mismatch *Bond convexity *Bond duration *Bond (finance) *Covered interest arbitrage *Debt sculpting *Duration gap *Hedging *Interest rate parity *Interest rate swap ==References== ==External links== *Guide to Hedging Interest Rate Risk ==Further reading== * Wesley Phoa, Advanced Fixed Income Analytics, Frank J.

  "content": "Ping An Insurance known also as Ping An of China (), full name Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. is a Chinese holding conglomerate whose subsidiaries mainly deal with insurance, banking, and financial services. The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Shenzhen. \"Ping An\" literally means \"safe and well\". Ping An ranked 7th on the Forbes Global 2000 list and 29th on the Fortune Global 500 list. The company is considered to be China's biggest insurer, with US$107 billion in gross premium income in 2018. Its market capitalization is at US$220 billion in July 2019, making it the world's largest insurer except for Berkshire Hathaway. Ping An Insurance is one of the top 50 companies in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It is also a constituent stock of Hang Seng Index, an index of the top 50 companies in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Ping An Insurance was also included in the pan-China stock indices CSI 300 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and Hang Seng China 50 Index. Ping An Insurance has been selected for the 2019 Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index (DJSI). It was the first insurance company from mainland China to be selected on the index. Ping An is a signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and was the first asset owner in mainland China to join. Ping An Insurance consistently ranks as the world's top global insurance brand, and as of 2018, was the third most valuable global financial brand in the world. ==Business== Ping An Insurance Group started off in 1988 as a property and casualty insurance company, later diversifying into life insurance, banking, asset management, brokerage services, and private equity investing. The company's embrace of technology through its utilization of an array of financial technology platforms and services for customers has made it a diversified financial conglomerate. Ping An is one of the few companies in China with licenses to offer a full suite of financial services, including insurance, banking, trusts, securities, futures and financial leasing. Since the mid-1990s, Ping An has been diversifying into financial services from its core business of insurance, and has subsequently taken investments from overseas firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in 1994. In 2002 HSBC took a large equity interest in Ping An. In early 2008, Ping An agreed to take a 50% share in Fortis Investments, a subsidiary of Fortis,The Ping An-Fortis Deal: Who Really Wins? , Caijing Magazine, 3 April 2008 which had taken over ABN AMRO Asset Management as a result of the split up of ABN AMRO in late 2007; the deal was canceled in October 2008. In June 2009, Ping An became a strategic investor in Shenzhen Development Bank, (now part of Ping An Bank). In 2016, Ping An invested more overseas. In January in 2017, Deputy Head Cai Lifeng resigned for personal reasons. ===Technology-Powered Business Transformation=== Ping An invests 1% of its revenues into R\u0026D; (which itself consists of 10% of its annual profits), specifically, on new technologies of AI, Blockchain and Cloud Computing for ten years to transform its financial services and support the building of its five ecosystems: financial services, healthcare, auto services, real estate services, and smart city services. More than 576 million users and 100 Chinese cities are connected to at least one of those ecosystems. Over the years, Ping An has successfully launched fintech and healthtech businesses such as Lufax Holding, OneConnect, Ping An Good Doctor (1833.HK), and Ping An HealthKonnect. Supporting Business Development with Three Core Technologies *AI: With the philosophy of “change people’s lives for the better in ways and forms”, Ping An is applying its AI technologies in financial, healthcare and smart city services. Ping An has world-leading facial, voiceprint and medical image recognition technologies. It is number one in AI medical imaging, for instance, with more than 95% accuracy in the authoritative LUNA rankings for imaging in two categories for lung diseases. *Blockchain: Ping An's OneConnect platform is one of the largest commercial blockchain platform in the world with over 44,000 blockchain nodes providing services to over 3,000 financial institutions. Through its self-developed FiMAX proprietary blockchain technology, its zero- knowledge proof algorithm and low latency design is able to reach 50,000 transactions per second. *Cloud Computing: Ping An Cloud offers efficient and secure services for industries in finance, health care, auto, real estate and smart city. In 2018, Ping An Cloud successfully became GitHub's first managed serviced provider (MSP) in Greater China. GitHub will provide GitHub Enterprise products and services to China enterprises through Ping An Cloud. ==Ownership== Ping An is a publicly listed company. It is China's first joint- stock insurance company. Beginning in the 1990s, Ping An took advantage of widening reforms to become the first Chinese financial institution in which foreign firms could own equity: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were early backers. The company eventually went public in 2004, listing in Hong Kong and subsequently also listed in Shanghai in 2007. As at 30 June 2020, Charoen Pokphand Group is the biggest investor in Ping An, holding 8.81% stake. Shenzhen Government via Shenzhen Investment Holdings () and Shum Yip Group (), still owned a combined 6.68% stake (5.27% + 1.41%) as the second largest shareholder. Ping An has the classification of a civilian-run enterprise. Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, said that \"the true ownership of large chunks of its shares remains unclear\" and that the ownership of Ping An is a \"murky structure\".McGregor, p. 204 -205. In October 2012, The New York Times reported that relatives and associates of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao controlled stakes in Ping An worth at least US$2.2 billion in 2007.David Barboza, \"Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader\" , The New York Times, 25 October 2012. Retrieved 27 October 2012. They paid the equivalent of 40 cents a share, others buying at the same time paid as much as $1.20. Thanks to favorable regulatory treatment and licensing, the firm was able to build a diversified financial firm with interests in insurance, brokerage, and banking. Premier Wen Jiabao's family responded to The New York Time's report, claiming its statement about their family's wealth is \"untrue\". Two lawyers later released a statement on behalf of Wen's family denying the other claims made, and asserting that the premier's 90-year-old mother has never held a US$120 million of Ping An Insurance's investment, as the paper had reported. HSBC acquired 48.22% of H shares by means of different HSBC subsidiaries (H share accounted for 34.83% of the share capital as at 31 December 2009, which was later increased to 41.88% in 2015 ). HSBC hold 16.80% of total shares of Ping An, making itself the biggest shareholder at 31 December 2009. On 5 December 2012, HSBC announced to sell their entire 15.57% stake for HK$72.736 billion (approx. US$9.385 billion; HK$59.00 per share) to Thailand conglomerate Charoen Pokphand. The deal would split into two phases, which the latter was subjected to the clearance from China Insurance Regulatory Commission, which would be paid in cash and a loan from China Development Bank to Charoen Pokphand. In February 2013 Charoen Pokphand got the clearance. On 10 May in spite of a lack of loan from the state-owned China Development Bank to Charoen Pokphand, the deal was completed. According to HSBC, the transaction would increase Tier 1 Capital ratio of the bank for 0.5%, as well as a post-tax gain of US$2.6 billion. HSBC had an above average forecasted CET1 ratio of 8.5% in 2011 European Union bank stress test under the adverse scenario, nevertheless HSBC chose to strengthen its capital by selling Ping An. The actual ratio at 31 December 2012 was 12.3%, increased 2.2% year-to-yearly. == Markets == Since 24 June 2004 Ping An has been listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing) as . Since 1 March 2007, it has a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as . Ping An was chosen as an index stock of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), replacing Anhui Expressway in 2004.

  "content": "Radical Technologies is a non-fiction book by the UK-based American author Adam Greenfield. Subtitled 'The design of everyday life' it looks at the technologies that are transforming the world at an ever increasing rate. Greenfield's take on the influence of technologies such as blockchain and digital fabrication is generally speaking a pessimistic one. He is concerned about the atomisation of society as experience becomes individualised, and about how we are unwittingly handing over vast amounts of power to faceless corporations with very little debate from politicians and other leaders about what we actually want from technology. In the opening chapter on smartphones for example, whilst marvelling that the entire cartographic knowledge of the world and even our place in it is now available to us on a flat screen that we can hold in our hands, we are for the most part blissfully unaware of all of the interconnected technologies - the NAVSTAR satellite GPS systems, the vast data centres that process the information, the networking and wireless infrastructure that transmit the signals - that allow this functionality to exist. More importantly, Greenfield notes, so quickly has using a smartphone map ceased to be a wonder and become just part of every day live that \"we have become reliant on the network to accomplish our ordinary goals\".Greenfield, Adam, Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life, Verso, 2017. In the chapter on artificial intelligence (subtitled 'The eclipse of human discretion') Greenfield notes that machines can now do things that were until recently thought to be a uniquely human preserve, such as winning the strategy game Go or creating a highly plausible painting in the style of Rembrandt. In these and other areas where people had the edge, machines can now outperform human beings. AI learns fast and it will not be long before \"autonomous algorithmic systems acquire an effectively human level of cognitive ability\". What's more, he says, it is difficult to see how this eventuality can be prevented. The societal effects of automation also come under scrutiny. The most commonly held job in 29 of the 50 US states is truck driver. This will also be one of the first jobs to be automated out of existence. What will happen to the truck drivers then, the author asks. The book concludes with four possible scenarios that might play out as automation plays an increasing role in the mediation of every aspect of life. == Chapters == * Smartphone: The networking of the self * The internet of things: A planetary mesh of perception and response * Augmented reality: An interactive overlay on the world * Digital fabrication: Towards a political economy * Cryptocurrency: The computational guarantee of value * Blockchain beyond Bitcoin: A trellis for post-human institutions * Automation: The annihilation of work * Machine learning: The algorithmic production of knowledge * Artificial intelligence: The eclipse of human discretion * Radical technologies: The design of everyday life ==Critical reception== Radical technologies received positive reviews. The Guardian described it as “A tremendously intelligent and stylish book on the ‘colonization of everyday life by information processing'”, while Jennifer Howard in The Times Literary Supplement said it “provides a grounded guide, a cautionary tale in which each chapter walks readers through another layer of a dazzling and treacherous landscape”. Brian Eno described as it an “essential book”. == Notes == == References == * Greenfield, Adam. “Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life.

  "content": "Tax increment financing (TIF) is a public financing method that is used as a subsidy for redevelopment, infrastructure, and other community-improvement projects in many countries, including the United States. The original intent of a TIF program is to stimulate private investment with a blighted area that has been designated to be in need of economic revitalization. Similar or related value capture strategies are used around the world. Through the use of TIF, municipalities typically divert future property tax revenue increases from a defined area or district toward an economic development project or public improvement project in the community. TIF subsidies are not appropriated directly from a city's budget, but the city incurs loss through foregone tax revenue. The first TIF was used in California in 1952. By 2004, all 50 American states had authorized the use of TIF, except Arizona. The first TIF in Canada was used in 2007.If the cost of basic services increases, with TIF in place, the result is a revenue shortfall that has to be paid from sources other than tax revenues of the TIF district to prevent service cuts. ==Use of Tax Increment Financing== Tax increment financing (TIF) subsidies, which are used for both publicly subsidized economic development and municipal projects, have provided the means for cities and counties to gain approval of redevelopment of blighted properties or public projects such as city halls, parks, libraries etc. The definition of blight has taken on a broad inclusion of nearly every type of land including farmland, which has given rise to much of the criticism. \" To provide the needed subsidy, the urban renewal district, or TIF district, is essentially always drawn around hundreds or thousands of acres of additional real estate (beyond the project site) to provide the needed borrowing capacity for the project or projects. The borrowing capacity is established by committing all normal yearly future real estate tax increases from every parcel in the TIF district (for 20–25 years, or more) along with the anticipated new tax revenue eventually coming from the project or projects themselves. If the projects are public improvements paying no real estate taxes, all of the repayment will come from the adjacent properties within the TIF district. Although questioned, it is often presumed that even public improvements trigger gains in taxes above what occurs, or would have occurred in the district without the investment. In many jurisdictions yearly property tax increases are restricted and cannot exceed what would otherwise have occurred. The completion of a public or private project can at times result in an increase in the value of surrounding real estate, which generates additional tax revenue. Sales-tax revenue may also increase, and jobs may be added, although these factors and their multipliers usually do not influence the structure of TIF. The routine yearly increases district-wide, along with any increase in site value from the public and private investment, generate an increase in tax revenues. This is the \"tax increment.\" Tax increment financing dedicates tax increments within a certain defined district to finance the debt that is issued to pay for the project. TIF was designed to channel funding toward improvements in distressed, underdeveloped, or underutilized parts of a jurisdiction where development might otherwise not occur. TIF creates funding for public or private projects by borrowing against the future increase in these property-tax revenues.Various, (2001). Tax Increment Financing and Economic Development, Uses, Structures and Impact. Edited by Craig L. Johnson and Joyce Y. Man. State University of New York Press. ==History== Tax increment financing was first used in California in 1952 and there are currently thousands of TIF districts still currently operate nationwide in the US, from small and mid-sized cities to large urban areas. As of 2008, California had over four hundred TIF districts with an aggregate of over $10 billion per year in revenues, over $28 billion of long-term debt, and over $674 billion of assessed land valuation. The state of California discontinued the use of TIF financing due to lawsuits in 2011, and enacted the California Fiscal Emergency Proclamation 2010, thereby ending the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding, including the use of TIFs for the funding of the nearly 400 redevelopment agencies in the state.\"Urban Renewal Dead in California,\" The Antiplanner, Thoreau Institute (2 January 2012).See California Redevelopment Association v. Ana Matosantos. The RDAs appealed that decision, though they were eventually eliminated in February 2012 after the passage of the 2011 state budget. However, in 2015, the California Community Revitalization and Investment Authority Act was made law, providing for the creation of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs), funded by Tax-Increment Financing. The primary purposes of CRIAs are the development or preservation of affordable housing for low and moderate income households (a minimum of 25% of TIF funding must be placed in an affordable housing fund) and creation or upgrading of public infrastructure in economically disadvantaged areas as defined under the provisions of the law. Additionally, Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) may be created and financed by TIFs in the California. With the exception of Arizona, every state and the District of Columbia has enabled legislation for tax increment financing.Council of Development Finance Agencies 2008 TIF State-By- State Report accessed 2014-3-21. Some states, such as Illinois, have used TIF for decades, but others have only recently embraced TIF.Arkansas (2000), Washington (2001), New Jersey (2002), Delaware (2003), Louisiana (2003), North Carolina (2005), and New Mexico (2006). The state of Maine has a program named TIF; however, this title refers to a process very different than in most states. Since the 1970s, the following factors have led local governments (cities, townships, etc.) to consider tax increment financing: lobbying by developers, a reduction in federal funding for redevelopment-related activities (including spending increases), restrictions on municipal bonds (which are tax-exempt bonds), the transfer of urban policy to local governments, State-imposed caps on municipal property tax collections, and State-imposed limits on the amounts and types of city expenditures. Considering these factors, many local governments have chosen TIF as a way to strengthen their tax bases, attract private investment, and increase economic activity. ==Urban regeneration== In a 2015 literature review on best practices in urban regeneration, with cities across the United States seeking ways to reverse trends of unemployment, declining population and disinvestment in their core downtown areas, as developers continue to expand into suburban areas. Re-investment in downtown core areas include mixed-use development and new or improved transit systems. With successful revitalization comes gentrification with higher property values and taxes, and the exodus of lower income earners. == Unintended consequences == TIF districts have attracted much criticism. Some question whether TIF districts actually serve their resident populations. An organization called Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform (MORR) holds regular conferences on redevelopment abuse. Here are further claims made by TIF opponents: *As investment in an area increases, it is not uncommon for real estate values to rise and for gentrification to occur. * Although generally sold to legislatures as a tool to redevelop blighted areas, some districts are drawn up where development would happen anyway, such as ideal development areas at the edges of cities. California has passed legislation designed to curb this abuse. * The designation of urban areas as \"blighted,\" essential to most TIF implementation, can allow governmental condemnation of property through eminent domain laws. The famous Kelo v. City of New London United States Supreme Court case, where homes were condemned for a private development, arose over actions within a TIF district. *The TIF process arguably leads to favoritism for politically connected developers, implementing attorneys, economic development officials, and others involved in the processes. * In some cases, school districts within communities using TIF are experiencing larger increases in state aid than districts not in such communities. This may be creating an incentive for governments to \"over-TIF,\" consequently taking on riskier development projects. Local governments are under no obligation to recognize when TIF designation would adversely affect a school district's financial condition, and consequently the quality of some schools can be compromised. * Normal inflationary increases in property values can be captured with districts in poorly written TIFs, representing money that would have gone into the public coffers even without the financed improvements. * Districts can be drawn excessively large thus capturing revenue from areas that would have appreciated in value regardless of TIF designation. * Approval of districts can sometimes capture one entity's future taxes without its official input, i.e. a school districts taxes will be frozen on action of a city. * Capturing the full tax increment and directing it to repay the development bonds ignores the fact that the incremental increase in property value likely requires an increase in the provision of public services, which will now have to be funded from elsewhere (often from subsidies from less economically thriving areas). For example, the use of tax increment financing to create a large residential development means that public services from schools to public safety will need to be expanded, yet if the full tax increment is captured to repay the development bonds, other money will have to be used. ==Examples== ===Chicago=== The city of Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois, has a significant number of TIF districts and has become a prime location for examining the benefits and disadvantages of TIF districts. The city runs 131 districts with tax receipts totaling upwards of $500 million for 2006. Lori Healey, appointed commissioner of the city's Planning and Development department in 2005 was instrumental in the process of approving TIF districts as first deputy commissioner. The Chicago Reader, a Chicago alternative newspaper published weekly, has published articles regarding tax increment financing districts in and around Chicago. Written by staff writer Ben Joravsky, the articles are critical of tax increment financing districts as implemented in Chicago. Cook County Clerk David Orr, in order to bring transparency to Chicago and Cook County tax increment financing districts, began to feature information regarding Chicago area districts on his office's website. The information featured includes City of Chicago TIF revenue by year, maps of Chicago and Cook County suburban municipalities' TIF districts. The Neighborhood Capital Budget Group of Chicago, Illinois, a non-profit organization, advocated for area resident participation in capital programs. The group also researched and analyzed the expansion of Chicago's TIF districts. In April 2009, the \"TIF Sunshine Ordinance\" introduced by Alderman Scott Waguespack and Alderman Manuel Flores (then 1st Ward Alderman) passed City Council. The ordinance made all TIF Redevelopment Agreements and attachments available on the City's website in a searchable electronic format. The proposal intended to improve the overall transparency of TIF Agreements, thereby facilitating significantly increased public accountability. According to an article published in the Journal of Property Tax Assessment \u0026 Administration in 2009, the increase in the use of TIF in Chicago resulted in a \"substantial portion of Chicago's property tax base and the land area\" being subsumed by these levy zones — \"26 percent of the city’s land area and almost a quarter of the total value of commercial property is in TIF districts\" by 2007. The study notes the difficulties in establishing how effective TIF are. ===Albuquerque=== Currently, the 2nd largest TIF project in America is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico: the $500 million Mesa del Sol development. Mesa del Sol is controversial in that the proposed development would be built upon a \"green field\" that presently generates little tax revenue and any increase in tax revenue would be diverted into a tax increment financing fund. This \"increment\" thus would leave governmental bodies without funding from the developed area that is necessary for the governmental bodies' operation. ===Detroit=== In July 2014, Detroit's Downtown Development Authority announced TIF financing for the new Red Wings hockey stadium. The total project cost, including additional private investments in retail and housing, is estimated at $650 million, of which $250 million will be financed using TIF capture to repay 30-year tax exempt bonds purchased by the Michigan Strategic Fund, the state's economic development arm. ===California=== In an article published in 1998 the Public Policy Institute of California, Michael Dardia challenged the governing redevelopment agencies' (RDAs) assumption \"that redevelopment pays for itself through tax increment financing. The claim is that RDAs \"receive any increase in property tax revenues (above a 2 percent inflation factor) in project areas because their investment in area improvements is responsible for increasing property values.\" Dardia argued that property tax revenues channeled to tax increment financing results in revenues lost to \"other local jurisdictions—the county, schools, and special districts\" and if the RDAs \"are not largely responsible for the increase in property values, those jurisdictions are, in effect, subsidizing redevelopment, with no say in how the revenues are used.\" By December 6, 2010 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a fiscal emergency which was reaffirmed by Governor Jerry Brown in December 2011 to underscore \"the need for immediate legislative action to address California’s massive budget deficit.\" Governor Brown enacted measures to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property taxes from the public sector including, school districts, to RDAs. New legislation including Assembly Bill 26 and Assembly Bill 27 were passed, which led to the elimination of California's nearly 400 redevelopment agencies thereby stopping the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding. The RDAs appealed the decision however they were eventually eliminated. The state reintroduced the option of tax-increment financing for the funding of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs) in 2015, the latter being authorities created by local governments to create or upgrade infrastructure and create or preserve affordable housing for low and moderate income households. Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) in the state are also financed by a tax-increment bond and their purposes are largely similar, though the requirement for use and the projects covered are somewhat different. ====Alameda==== In 2009, SunCal Companies, an Irvine, California- based developer, introduced a ballot initiative that embodied a redevelopment plan for the former Naval Air Station Alameda and a financial plan based in part on roughly $200 million worth of tax increment financing to pay for public amenities. SunCal structured the initiative so that the provision of public amenities was contingent on receiving tax increment financing, and on the creation of a community facilities (Mello-Roos) district, which would levy a special (extra) tax on property owners within the development. Since Alameda City Council did not extend the Exclusive Negotiation Agreement with Suncal, this project will not move forward. In California, Community Redevelopment Law governs the use of tax increment financing by public agencies. ===Iowa=== In 2002 economists at Department of Economics Iowa State University, claimed that \"existing taxpayers, its householders, wage earners, and retirees are aggressively subsidizing business growth and population\" TIF designated zones in Iowa. ===Wisconsin=== TIFs were established in Wisconsin in 1975. In 2001 critics argued that TIF supported developers to develop in green spaces citing a 2000 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin report which stated that 45% of tax incremental financing districts were used to develop open space land. ===Denver=== From 1995 through 2005 Denver tax payers were able to leverage over $5 billion in private investment by committing to over half a billion dollars of TIF subsidies. At that time new TIF subsidized projects under consideration included the \"redevelopment of the old Gates Rubber Factory complex at I-25 and Broadway, and the realization of Denver’s ambitious plans for the downtown Union Station area.\" Denver's urban landscape was transformed from 1995 through 2005 through TIF-subsidized projects such as \"the landmark resurrection\" of the Denver Dry Goods building, the Adams Mark hotel, Denver Pavilions, and REI flagship store, Broadway Marketplace shopping area and the demolition of the old Woolworth's building, the relocation and expansion of Elitch's into the Six Flags Elitch Gardens Amusement park, the redevelopment of Lowry Air Force Base and the redevelopment of the old Stapleton airport – \"the largest urban infill project in the nation.\" By 2005 the City Denver had already \"mortgaged over $500 million in future tax revenue to pay off existing TIF subsidies to private developers\" and was preparing to \"increase that sum substantially with several new TIF projects in the next five years.\" In 2005 the \"diversions of tax revenue to pay for TIF subsidies [represented] an annual cost of almost $30 million to Denver taxpayers, and [were] rising rapidly.\" By 2007 TIF tax expenditures in the form of foregone tax revenue totaled nearly \"$30 million annually – equal to almost 7% of Denver’s entire annual General Fund revenues\" and at that time the amount was rapidly increasing. In a 2005 study it was revealed through wage surveys at TIF projects \"that jobs there pay substantially less than Denver average wages, and 14%-27% less even than average wages for comparable occupational categories.\" In part 1 of a three part series researchers \"explained the history and mechanics of TIF, and analyzed the total cost of TIF to Denver taxpayers, including “hidden” costs from increased public service burdens that TIF projects do not pay for.\" In \"Who Profits from TIF Subsidies?\" researchers \"examined the types of businesses Denver attracts through TIF, and the profit rates of developers with whom Denver partners to bring TIF projects into existence, and the transparency of the TIF approval process.\" In part three of the study researchers examined \"quality and housing affordability at TIF- subsidized projects.\" ==Applications and administration== Cities use TIF to finance public infrastructure, land acquisition, demolition, utilities and planning costs, and other improvements including sewer expansion and repair, curb and sidewalk work, storm drainage, traffic control, street construction and expansion, street lighting, water supply, landscaping, park improvements, environmental remediation, bridge construction and repair, and parking structures. State enabling legislation gives local governments the authority to designate tax increment financing districts. The district usually lasts 20 years, or enough time to pay back the bonds issued to fund the improvements. While arrangements vary, it is common to have a city government assuming the administrative role, making decisions about how and where the tool is applied. Most jurisdictions only allow bonds to be floated based upon a portion (usually capped at 50%) of the assumed increase in tax revenues. For example, if a $5,000,000 annual tax increment is expected in a development, which would cover the financing costs of a $50,000,000 bond, only a $25,000,000 bond would be typically allowed. If the project is moderately successful, this would mean that a good portion of the expected annual tax revenues (in this case over $2,000,000) would be dedicated to other public purposes other than paying off the bond. ==Community revitalization levy (CRL) in Canada== By 2015 major Canadian cities had already implemented community revitalization levies (CRL) — the term used for TIFs in Canada. ===Alberta=== In April 2012, it was proposed that the Alberta government change regulations so that the Community Revitalization Levy (CRL) could be applied to remediation costs \"incurred by a private developer.\" The Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC) — an arms- length a subsidiary of the City of Calgary, established in 2007, to revisit land use in the longtime deserted chunk of land in the east downtown core along the Bow River — used a CRL to develop Downtown East Village, Calgary making Calgary the first Canadian city to use the CRL. The CMLC \"committed approximately $CDN 357 million to East Village infrastructure and development\" and claims that it \"has attracted $CDN 2.4 billion of planned development that is expected to return $CDN 725 million of revenue to the CRL.\" The designated levy zone for the Rivers District CRL is wider than the East Village, making it financially sound since it collects taxes for twenty years on its anchor building, the 58-storey Bow tower, and from developments in nearby Victoria Park (Calgary). In an interview with the Calgary Sun in February 2015, Michael Brown, CRL president and CEO said they were looking into a CRL for the development of the West Village similar to that used to finance the remediation of the East Village. In August CalgaryNEXT sports complex was proposed as a potential anchor to the levy zone. Local politicians expressed concern about the funding model, which proposed that the city would front between $440 and $690 million of the projected cost, most which would only be recouped over a long period of time. Mayor Naheed Nenshi commented that one of a number of challenges to the CalgaryNEXT proposal was the requirement of a community revitalization levy, along with the need for a land contribution from the City, \"and significant investments in infrastructure to make the West Village a complete and vibrant community.\" Edmonton, Alberta creating a CRL to revitalize the downtown with a massive development project including a new arena, park development and upgrades including sewers which total approximately $CDN 500 million. The city hopes to \"generate approximately $941 million in revenue in a medium-growth scenario.\" ===Ontario=== Toronto's Mayor John Tory plans on creating a levy zone to finance a massive $CDN 2.7-billion SmartTrack surface rail line project spanning 53 kilometres. == See also == * Public finance * Value capture == References == == External links == *Scott, Brendan S., 2013 \"Factors that Influence the Size of Tax Increment Financing Districts in Texas\" Applied Research Project, Texas State University. * An abstract of Weber's Equity and Entrepreneurialism: The Impact of Tax Increment Financing on School Finance (2003). * An abstract of Weber, et al.'s \"Does Tax Increment Financing Raise Urban Industrial Property Values?\" (2003). * Category:Tax policy ",

  "content": "IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of things (IoT). It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, motivated by a potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers. IOTA does not use miners to validate transactions, instead, users that issue a new transaction must approve two previous transactions and perform a small amount of proof of work. Transactions can therefore be issued without fees, facilitating microtransactions. IOTA has been criticized due to its unusual design, of which it is unclear whether it will work in practice. The network currently achieves consensus through a coordinator node, operated by the IOTA foundation. As the coordinator is a single point of failure, the network is currently centralized. IOTA has been the subject of multiple phishing, scamming, and hacking attempts, which resulted in the thefts of user tokens and extended periods of downtime. == History == The IOTA ledger was created in 2015 by David Sønstebø, Dominik Schiener, Sergey Ivancheglo, and Serguei Popov. Initial development was funded by an online public crowdsale, with the participants buying the IOTA value token with other digital currencies. Approximately 1300 BTC were raised, corresponding to approximately 500,000 USD at that time, and the total token supply was distributed pro-rata over the initial investors. The IOTA network went live in 2016. === IOTA foundation === In 2017, early IOTA token investors donated 5% of the total token supply for continued development and to endow what became later became the IOTA foundation. In 2018, the IOTA Foundation was chartered as a Stiftung in Berlin, with the goal to assist in the research and development, education and standardisation of IOTA technology. The IOTA foundation is a board member of International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), and founding member of the trusted-IoT alliance and mobility open blockchain initiative (MOBI), to promote blockchain and distributed ledgers in regulatory approaches, the IoT ecosystem and mobility. == Characteristics == === The Tangle === The Tangle is the moniker used to describe IOTAs directed acyclic graph (DAG) transaction settlement and data integrity layer. It is structured as a string of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored through a network of node participants. The Tangle does not have miners validating transactions, rather, network participants are jointly responsible for transaction validation, and must confirm two transactions already submitted to the network for every one transaction they issue. Transactions can therefore be issued to the network at no cost, facilitating micropayments. To avoid spam, every transaction requires computational resources based on Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms, to find the answer to a simple cryptographic puzzle. IOTA supports both value and data transfers. A second layer protocol provides encryption and authentication of messages, or data streams, transmitted and stored on the Tangle as zero-value transactions. Each message holds a reference to the address of a follow-up message, connecting the messages in a data stream, and providing forward secrecy. Authorised parties with the correct decryption key can therefore only follow a datastream from their point of entry. When the owner of the data stream wants to revoke access, it can change the decryption key when publishing a new message. This provides the owner granular controls over the way in which data is exchanged to authorised parties. === IOTA token === The IOTA token is a unit of value in the IOTA network. There is a fixed supply of 2,779,530,283,277,761 iota tokens in circulation on the IOTA network. IOTA tokens are stored in IOTA wallets protected by an 81-character seed, similar to a password. To access and spend the tokens, IOTA provides a cryptocurrency wallet. A hardware wallet can be used to keep credentials offline while facilitating transactions. ===Coordinator node=== IOTA requires a majority of honest actors to prevent network attacks. However, as the concept of mining does not exist on the IOTA network, it is unlikely that this requirement will always be met. Therefore, consensus is currently obtained through referencing of transactions issued by a special node operated by the IOTA foundation, called the coordinator. The coordinator issues zero value transactions at given time intervals, called milestones. Any transaction, directly or indirectly, referenced by such a milestone is considered valid by the nodes in the network. The coordinator is an authority operated by the IOTA foundation and as such single point of failure for the IOTA network, which makes the network highly centralized. === Markets === IOTA is traded on digital currency exchanges such as Bitfinex, and listed under the MIOTA ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency. Like other digital currencies, IOTA’s token value has soared and fallen. The token’s valuation fell back to $1 billion in early 2018 as a wider crypto rout sent currencies sinking. In 2019 the IOTA token missed out entirely and was down on the year. == Applications and testbeds == Proof-of-concepts building on IOTA technology are being developed in the automotive and IoT industry by corporates as Volkswagen and Bosch. IOTA is applied in smart city testbeds, including development of community grids and local trade of energy. Jaguar Land Rover is testing software that will allow drivers of its cars to earn the IOTA cryptocurrency as a reward for sharing data. In project Alvarium, formed under the Linux Foundation, IOTA is used as an immutable storage and validation mechanism. STMicroelectronics has provided IOTA middleware for their STM32-based boards. On February 11, 2020, the Eclipse Foundation and IOTA Foundation jointly launched the Tangle EE (Enterprise Edition) Working Group. Tangle EE is aimed at enterprise users that can take IOTA technology and enable larger organizations to build applications on top of the project, where the Eclipse Foundation will provide a vendor-neutral governance framework . IOTA foundation has faced criticism in response to their announcements of partnerships. In 2017, IOTA released the data marketplace, a pilot for a market where connected sensors or devices can store, sell or purchase data. The cryptocurrency community was critical towards the announcement of the data marketplace over the extent of the involvement of the participants of the data marketplace. Izabelle Kaminska criticized the Jaguar press release, as \"the impact of the release across the media space was decidedly one presenting the service as a fait accompli\", and \"our interpretation is that it's very unlikely Jaguar will be bringing a smart- wallet-enabled earn-cryptocurrency-as-you-drive offering to the marketplace any time soon.\" == Vulnerabilities and attacks == === DCI Curl-P-27 vulnerability disclosure === On September 8th, 2017, researchers Ethan Heilman from Boston University and Neha Nerula et al. from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) reported on potential security flaws with IOTA's Curl-P-27 hash function. The authors were able to quickly create messages of the same length which hash to the same value with Curl-P-27, breaking the function’s collision resistance. Using this collision attack, they could generate signature forgeries in IOTA. In response to the disclosure, the IOTA Foundation changed the hash function in the node reference implementation from Curl-P-27 to Kerl (a trinary adaption of SHA-3) on August 7th 2017. According to IOTA cofounder Sergey Ivancheglo, the DCI found the protocol's purposefully placed form of copy protection. The “practical attack” demonstrated by the DCI researchers only works in a limited number of improbable situations that would affect a negligible number of IOTA users, mostly thanks to a closed-source and centralized solution called the “Coordinator” that helps secure the network. The IOTA foundation received considerable backlash in their handling of the incident. FT Alphaville reported legal posturing by an IOTA Founder against a security researcher for his involvement in the DCI report, as well as instances of aggressive language levelled against a Forbes contributor and other unnamed journalists covering the DCI report. The Center for Blockchain Technologies at the University College London severed ties with the IOTA Foundation in late April 2018 due to legal threats against security researchers involved in the report. Former MIT media lab director, Joi Ito raised flags about the IOTA management team saying that IOTA's Sergey Ivancheglo gave “two conflicting explanations” for the security bug. Multicoin capital co-founder Kyle Samani wrote that IOTA has “one of the worst mgmt teams in crypto.” Dan Guido, CEO from Trail of Bits said “DCI made some rookie mistakes too, and this is generally why, in other industries, security researchers will hand off bugs to a vulnerability coordinator, like a CERT, to report on their behalf”. Venture Capitalist Jamie Burke told, “IOTA has issues, largely around their communications, but we believe in the vision and we believe in the innovation”. === 13 or M attack and reclaim === In October 2017, after the IOTA developers transitioned from using Curl-P-27 to using Kerl, an unrelated vulnerability called the 13 or M attack was discovered, a bug that put the IOTA tokens of certain users at risk by partially revealing a portion of the private key generated for specific addresses. This would have made it easier for malicious attackers to potentially “brute force” hack the remainder of those addresses’ private keys and thereby steal the tokens. The IOTA Foundation patched this vulnerability by requiring that if a message hash to be signed includes a 13, then the user must alter the message until no 13s are present in the digest. As an additional remediation step, the IOTA developers transferred potentially compromised funds to addresses under its control, providing a process for users to later apply to the IOTA Foundation in order to reclaim their funds === Seed-generator scam === On Januari 2018 more than 10 million USD worth of IOTA tokens were stolen from users that used an online seed-creator, a password that protects their ownership of IOTA tokens. The seed-generator scam was the largest fraud in IOTA history to date, with several hundred people affected. One year later, in Januari 2019, the UK and German law enforcement agencies arrested a 36-year old man from Oxford, England. Matthias Krekeler, of the State Criminal Police in Hesse, said the arrest was only possible thanks to the \"sophisticated collaboration of international authorities\", and the investigation had been helped by \"IOTA community members\". === Trinity wallet attack incident === On November 26, 2019 a hacker discovered a vulnerability in Trinity, a mobile and desktop wallet managed by the IOTA foundation. The attacker compromised over 50 IOTA seeds, resulting in the theft of approximately 2 Million USD worth in IOTA tokens. The attack vector was opened via integration of a third party payment service, called MoonPay. The attacker was able to intercept DNS queries with a compromised Cloudflare API key, and managed to have his own malicious version rolled out instead of the third-party code. On February 10, 2020 MoonPay noticed the hack, resolved the vulnerability in its API, yet did not disclose the hack to the community. With the route of attack now gone, the hacker started clearing the funds from the 50 compromised seeds on February 11, 2020. After receiving reports that hackers were stealing funds from user wallets, the IOTA Foundation shut down the coordinator, a node in the IOTA network that puts the final seal of approval on any IOTA currency transaction, on February 12, 2020. The never-before-seen move was meant to prevent hackers from executing new thefts, but also had the side-effect of effectively shutting down the entire IOTA cryptocurrency. As the hack may have affected any user of the desktop versions of Trinity who opened the wallet between December 17 and February 17, the IOTA Foundation presented a 10-day seed migration period before restarting the coordinator. Users at-risk were given seven days to migrate their potentially compromised seed to a new seed, until March 7, 2020. The coordinator was restarted on March 10, 2020. == Criticism == IOTA promises to achieve the same benefits that blockchain-based DLTs bring - decentralization, distribution, immutability and trust - but remove the downsides of wasted resources associated with mining as well as transaction costs. However, several of the design features of IOTA are unusual, and it is unclear whether they work in practice. === Network consensus and coordinator node === The security of IOTA's consensus mechanism against double-spending attacks is unclear, as long as the network is immature. Essentially, in the IoT, with heterogeneous devices having varying levels of low computational power, sufficiently strong computational resources will render the tangle insecure. This is a problem in traditional proof-of-work blockchains as well, however, they provide a much greater degree of security through higher fault tolerance and transaction fees. At the beginning, when there is a lower number of participants and incoming transactions, a central coordinator is needed to prevent an attack on the IOTA tangle. Critics have opposed role of the coordinator for being the single source of consensus in the IOTA network. Polychain Capital founder Carlson-Wee, says “IOTA is not decentralized, even though IOTA makes that claim, because it has a central “coordinator node” that the network needs to operate. If a regulator or a hacker shut down the coordinator node, the network would go down.” During the Trinity attack incident, the IOTA foundation shutdown the coordinator to prevent further thefts, thereby demonstrating that the network is not decentralized in its current state. Last year the IOTA Foundation announced that it would like to operate the network without a coordinator in the future, but implementation of this is still in an early development phase. === Quantum resistance and address re-use === IOTA is resistant against quantum computer attacks, due to its use of the Winternitz One Time Signature (WOTS) scheme, which is quantum resistant. Due to IOTA’s choice of one-time signature scheme, spending from an address multiple times drastically reduces the security of the funds at that address, because it exposes portions of the private key associated with the address. Stolen funds due to the 13 or M attack were initially suspected to be the result of address reuse, only later to be identified as a result of a broken key derivation function, found Willem Pinckaers, a researcher of security firm Lekkertech. === Ternary implementation === For potential efficiency reasons, IOTA's data structures uses a balanced ternary implementation; instead of bits, it uses trits (−1, 0, 1). With all existing hash designs being binary, a ternary prototype called Curl-P had been developed, instead of the well-studied alternatives that underpin other digital coins. However, efficient cryptanalytic attacks on Curl-P have been devised, implying that it cannot be considered a strong cryptographic hash function. After vulnerabilities were detected in Curl-P, the hashing algorithm was changed to Kerl, which is considered safe. However, as a binary design Kerl is not inherently suitable for direct implementation on ternary platforms and a drop-in replacement, called Troika, is currently developed. === Network maturity === IOTA has seen several network outages as a result of bugs in the coordinator as well as DDoS attacks. During the seed generator scam, a DDoS network attack was abused leaving initial thefts undetected. To improve the network, IOTA Foundation is moving on with its plans for the Chrysalis project, a scheme designed to create an enterprise-ready blockchain solution. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Cryptocurrencies ",
