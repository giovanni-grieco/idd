  "content": "Comprehensive Electronic Office, often referred to by its initialism CEO, was a suite of office automation software from Data General introduced in 1981. It included word processing, e-mail, spreadsheets, business graphics and desktop accessories. The software was developed mostly in PL/I on and for the AOS and AOS/VS operating systems. ==Overview== CEO was considered Office Automation Software. Office Automation software was an attempt to create a \"paperless office\". CEO has also been cited as an example of an executive information system and as a decision support system. It included a main program known as the Control Program which offered a menu driven interface on the assorted dumb terminals which existed at the time. The Control Program communicated with separate \"Services\" like the Mail Server, Calendar Server, File Server (for documents). There was also a Word Processor and a data management program which was also accessible from the Control Program. In 1985, DataGeneral announced a complementary product, TEO (Technical Electronic Office), focused on the office automation needs of engineering professionals. In later years, CEO offerings grew to include various products to connect to CEO from early personal computers. The first such product was called CEO Connection. Later a product named CEO Object Office shipped which repackaged HP NewWave (an object oriented graphical interface). CEO code was heavily dependent on the INFOS II database. When Data General moved from the Eclipse MV platform to the AViiON, CEO was not ported to the new platform as the cost would have been prohibitive. CEO was often compared with IBM's offering commonly called PROFS. CEO offered integration with DISOSS and SNADS. CEO also supported Xodiac, Data General's proprietary networking system. In 1989, Data General unveiled an email gateway product, Communications Server, which provided interoperability of CEO with X.400 email systems and X.500 directories. One early CEO site, Deutsche Credit in Chicago, first installed CEO while it was under beta in 1980, and by 1986 had 80 users of the product. Other users included the U.S. Forest Service, who installed CEO in 1983, and whose CEO system fell victim to a hacking attack in December 1984. CEO was also formerly used by Health and Welfare Canada as its departmental email system. ==References== Category:Office suites Category:Data General Category:Email systems ",

  "content": "Concurrent engineering (CE) is a work methodology emphasizing the parallelization of tasks (i.e. performing tasks concurrently), which is sometimes called simultaneous engineering or integrated product development (IPD) using an integrated product team approach. It refers to an approach used in product development in which functions of design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other functions are integrated to reduce the time required to bring a new product to market. ==Introduction== A 2008 publication described concurrent engineering as a new design management system that has matured in recent years to become a well-defined systems approach to optimizing design and engineering cycles.Ma, Y., Chen, G. \u0026 Thimm, G.; \"Paradigm Shift: Unified and Associative Feature-based Concurrent Engineering and Collaborative Engineering\", Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, Concurrent engineering has been implemented in a number of companies, organizations, and universities, most notably in the aerospace industry. Beginning in the early 1990s, CE was also adapted for use in the information and content automation field, providing a basis for organization and management of projects outside the physical product development sector for which it was originally designed. Organizations such as the European Space Agency's Concurrent Design Facility make use of concurrent design to perform feasibility studies for future missions. The basic premise for concurrent engineering revolves around two concepts. The first is the idea that all elements of a product's life- cycle—from functionality, production, assembly, testing, maintenance, environmental impact, and finally disposal and recycling—should be taken into careful consideration in the early design phases.Kusiak, Andrew; Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques The second concept is that design activities should all be occurring at the same time, i.e., concurrently. The idea is that the concurrent nature of these activities significantly increases productivity and product quality.Quan, W. \u0026 Jianmin, H., A Study on Collaborative Mechanism for Product Design in Distributed Concurrent Engineering IEEE 2006. DOI: 10.1109/CAIDCD.2006.329445 This way, errors and redesigns can be discovered early in the design process when the project is still flexible. By locating and fixing these issues early, the design team can avoid what often become costly errors as the project moves to more complicated computational models and eventually into the actual manufacturing of hardware.Kusiak, Andrew, Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques As mentioned above, part of the design process is to ensure that the product's entire life cycle is taken into consideration. This includes establishing user requirements, propagating early conceptual designs, running computational models, creating physical prototypes, and eventually manufacturing the product. Included in this process is taking into full account funding, workforce capability, and time requirements. A 2006 study claimed that a correct implementation of the concurrent design process can save a significant amount of money, and that organizations have been moving to concurrent design for this reason. It is also highly compatible with systems thinking and green engineering. Concurrent engineering replaces the more traditional sequential design flow, or \"Waterfall Model\".\"The standard waterfall model for systems development\", NASA Webpage, November 14, 2008Kock, N. and Nosek, J., \"Expanding the Boundaries of E-Collaboration\", IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Vol 48 No 1, March 2005. In Concurrent Engineering an iterative or integrated development method is used instead.Ma, Y., Chen, G., Thimm, G., \"Paradigm Shift: Unified and Associative Feature-based Concurrent Engineering and Collaborative Engineering\", Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, The Waterfall method moves in a linear fashion, starting with user requirements and sequentially moving forward to design and implementation, until you have a finished product. In this design system, a design team would not quickly look backward or forward from the step it is on to fix or anticipate problems. In the case that something does go wrong, the design usually must be scrapped or heavily altered. The concurrent or iterative design process encourages prompt changes of tack, so that all aspects of the life cycle of the product are taken into account, allowing for a more evolutionary approach to design.Royce, Winston, \"Managing the Development of Large Software Systems\", Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (August 1970): 1-9. The difference between the two design processes can be seen graphically in Figure 1. Traditional \"Waterfall\" or Sequential Development Method vs. Iterative Development Method in concurrent engineering. A significant part of the concurrent design method is that the individual engineer is given much more say in the overall design process due to the collaborative nature of concurrent engineering. Giving the designer ownership is claimed to improve the productivity of the employee and quality of the product, based on the assumption that people who are given a sense of gratification and ownership over their work tend to work harder and design a more robust product, as opposed to an employee that is assigned a task with little say in the general process. ===Challenges associated with concurrent design=== Concurrent design comes with a series of challenges, such as implementation of early design reviews, dependency on efficient communication between engineers and teams, software compatibility, and opening up the design process.Kusiak, Andrew, \"Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques\" This design process usually requires that computer models (computer aided design, finite element analysis) are exchanged efficiently, something that can be difficult in practice. If such issues are not addressed properly, concurrent design may not work effectively.Rosenblatt, A. and Watson, G. (1991). \"Concurrent Engineering\", IEEE Spectrum, July, pp 22-37. It is important to note that although the nature of some project activities project imposes a degree of linearity—completion of software code, prototype development and testing, for example—organizing and managing project teams to facilitate concurrent design can still yield significant benefits that come from the improved sharing of information. Service providers exist that specialize in this field, not only training people how to perform concurrent design effectively, but also providing the tools to enhance the communication between the team members. ==Elements== ===Cross-functional teams=== Cross- functional teams include people from different area of the workplace that are all involved in a particular process, including manufacturing, hardware and software design, marketing, and so forth. ===Concurrent product realization=== Doing several things at once, such as designing various subsystems simultaneously, is critical to reducing design time and is at the heart of concurrent engineering. ===Incremental information sharing=== Incremental information sharing helps minimize the chance that concurrent product realization will lead to surprises. \"Incremental\" meaning that as soon as new information becomes available, it is shared and integrated into the design. Cross-functional teams are important to the effective sharing of information in a timely fashion. ===Integrated project management=== Integrated project management ensures that someone is responsible for the entire project, and that responsibility is not abdicated once one aspect of the work is done. ==Definition== Several definitions of concurrent engineering are in use. The first one is used by the Concurrent Design Facility (ESA): The second one is by Winner, et al., 1988: ==Using C.E.== Currently, several companies, agencies and universities use CE. Among them can be mentioned: * European Space Agency Concurrent Design Facility * NASA Team X - Jet Propulsion Laboratory * NASA Integrated Design Center (IDC), Mission Design Lab (MDL), and Instrument Design Lab (IDL) - Goddard Space Flight Center * CNES – French Space Agency * ASI – Italian Space Agency * Boeing * EADS Astrium – Satellite Design Office * Thales Alenia Space * The Aerospace Corporation Concept Design Center * STV Incorporated * German Aerospace Center Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt * EPFL Space Center * Schlumberger ==See also== * Concurrent design and manufacturing * ESA's Concurrent Design Facility * Open Concurrent Design Server * Product Life Cycle * Product lifecycle management ==References== Category:Project management techniques ",

  "content": "Deflection (f) in engineering In engineering, deflection is the degree to which a structural element is displaced under a load (due to its deformation). It may refer to an angle or a distance. The deflection distance of a member under a load can be calculated by integrating the function that mathematically describes the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load. Standard formulas exist for the deflection of common beam configurations and load cases at discrete locations. Otherwise methods such as virtual work, direct integration, Castigliano's method, Macaulay's method or the direct stiffness method are used. The deflection of beam elements is usually calculated on the basis of the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation while that of a plate or shell element is calculated using plate or shell theory. An example of the use of deflection in this context is in building construction. Architects and engineers select materials for various applications. == Beam deflection for various loads and supports == Beams can vary greatly in their geometry and composition. For instance, a beam may be straight or curved. It may be of constant cross section, or it may taper. It may be made entirely of the same material (homogeneous), or it may be composed of different materials (composite). Some of these things make analysis difficult, but many engineering applications involve cases that are not so complicated. Analysis is simplified if: :-The beam is originally straight, and any taper is slight :-The beam experiences only linear elastic deformation :-The beam is slender (its length to height ratio is greater than 10) :-Only small deflections are considered (max deflection less than 1/10 the span). In this case, the equation governing the beam's deflection (w) can be approximated as: :\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^2}=\\frac{M(x)}{E(x) I(x)} where the second derivative of its deflected shape with respect to x is interpreted as its curvature, E is the Young's modulus, I is the area moment of inertia of the cross-section, and M is the internal bending moment in the beam. If, in addition, the beam is not tapered and is homogeneous, and is acted upon by a distributed load q, the above expression can be written as: : EI~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^4 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x) This equation can be solved for a variety of loading and boundary conditions. A number of simple examples are shown below. The formulas expressed are approximations developed for long, slender, homogeneous, prismatic beams with small deflections, and linear elastic properties. Under these restrictions, the approximations should give results within 5% of the actual deflection. === Cantilever beams === Cantilever beams have one end fixed, so that the slope and deflection at that end must be zero. Schematic of the deflection of a cantilever beam. ==== End- loaded cantilever beams ==== Cantilever beam with a force on the free end The elastic deflection \\delta and angle of deflection \\phi (in radians) at the free end in the example image: A (weightless) cantilever beam, with an end load, can be calculated (at the free end B) using: : \\delta_B = \\frac {F L^3} {3 E I} : \\phi_B = \\frac {F L^2} {2 E I} where : F = Force acting on the tip of the beam : L = Length of the beam (span) : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of the beam's cross section Note that if the span doubles, the deflection increases eightfold. The deflection at any point, x, along the span of an end loaded cantilevered beam can be calculated using: : \\delta_x = \\frac {F x^2} {6 E I} (3L - x) : \\phi_x = \\frac {F x} {2 E I} (2L - x) Note: At x = L (the end of the beam), the \\delta_x and \\phi_x equations are identical to the \\delta_B and \\phi_B equations above. ==== Uniformly-loaded cantilever beams ==== Cantilever beam with a uniform distributed load The deflection, at the free end B, of a cantilevered beam under a uniform load is given by: : \\delta_B = \\frac {q L^4} {8 E I} : \\phi_B = \\frac {q L^3} {6 E I} where : q = Uniform load on the beam (force per unit length) : L = Length of the beam : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a uniformly loaded cantilevered beam can be calculated using: : \\delta_x = \\frac {q x^2} {24 E I}(6L^2 - 4L x + x^2) : \\phi_x = \\frac {q x} {6 E I}(3L^2 - 3L x + x^2) === Simply-supported beams === Simply-supported beams have supports under their ends which allow rotation, but not deflection. Schematic of the deflection of a simply-supported beam. ==== Center-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a force in the center The elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) of a beam, loaded at its center, supported by two simple supports is given by: : \\delta_C = \\frac {F L^3} {48 E I} where : F = Force acting on the center of the beam : L = Length of the beam between the supports : E = Modulus of Elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a center loaded simply supported beam can be calculated using: : \\delta_x = \\frac {F x} {48 E I}(3L^2 - 4x^2) for : 0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{L}{2} ==== Off-center-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a force off center The maximum elastic deflection on a beam supported by two simple supports, loaded at a distance a from the closest support, is given by: : \\delta_{max} = \\frac {F a (L^2 - a^2)^{3/2}} {9\\sqrt{3} L E I} where : F = Force acting on the beam : L = Length of the beam between the supports : E = Modulus of Elasticity : I = Area moment of Inertia of cross-section : a = Distance from the load to the closest support (i.e. a \\leq L/2) This maximum deflection occurs at a distance x_1 from the closest support and is given by: : x_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{L^2 - a^2}{3}} ==== Uniformly-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a uniform distributed load The elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) on a beam supported by two simple supports, under a uniform load (as pictured) is given by: : \\delta_C = \\frac{5 q L^4} {384 E I} Where : q = Uniform load on the beam (force per unit length) : L = Length of the beam : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a uniformly loaded simply supported beam can be calculated using: : \\delta_x = \\frac{q x} {24 E I} (L^3 - 2L x^2 + x^3) === Change in Length === The change in length \\Delta L of the beam is generally negligible in structures, but can be calculated by integrating the slope \\theta_x function, if the deflection function \\delta_x is known for all x. Where: : \\Delta L = change in length (always negative) : \\theta_x = slope function (first derivative of \\delta_x) : \\Delta L = -\\frac{1}{2}\\int^L_0(\\theta(x))^2dx Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain, 8th Edition Eq 8.1-14 If the beam is uniform and the deflection at any point is known, this can be calculated without knowing other properties of the beam. == Units == The formulas supplied above require the use of a consistent set of units. Most calculations will be made in the International System of Units (SI) or US customary units, although there are many other systems of units. === International system (SI) === :Force: Newton (N) Length: meters (m) :Modulus of Elasticity: \\frac{N}{m^2} (Pa) :Moment of Inertia: m^4 === US customary units (US) === :Force: Pounds force (lb_f) :Length: Inches (in) :Modulus of Elasticity: \\frac{lb_f}{in^2} :Moment of Inertia: in^4 === Others === Other units may be used as well, as long as they are self-consistent. For example, sometimes the kilogram force (kg_f) unit is used to measure loads. In such a case, the modulus of elasticity must be converted to \\frac{kg_f}{m^2}. == Structural deflection == Building codes determine the maximum deflection, usually as a fraction of the span e.g. 1/400 or 1/600. Either the strength limit state (allowable stress) or the serviceability limit state (deflection considerations among others) may govern the minimum dimensions of the member required. The deflection must be considered for the purpose of the structure. When designing a steel frame to hold a glazed panel, one allows only minimal deflection to prevent fracture of the glass. The deflected shape of a beam can be represented by the moment diagram, integrated (twice, rotated and translated to enforce support conditions). == See also == * Bending * Bending moment * Slope deflection method ==References== ==External links== *Deflection of beams *Beam Deflections Category:Engineering mechanics ",

  "content": "The Institute of Engineering (IOE) (Nepali: ईन्जिनियरिङ अध्ययन संस्थान), established in 1930, is the first technical school of Nepal. It was reformed in the present shape in 1972 as an organ of Tribhuvan University.IOE runs professional diplomas, undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs. The institute has four constituent and ten affiliated campuses in the country.It has five constituent campus namely Purwanchal Campus, Pashchimanchal Campus, Thapathali Campus, Pulchowk Campus and Chitwan Engineering Campus. == History == The history of engineering education in Nepal can be traced to 1930, when a Technical Training School was established. The engineering section of the school offered only trades and civil sub-overseers programs. In 1959, the Nepal Engineering Institute, with the assistance of the government of India, started offering civil overseer courses leading to a Diploma in Civil Engineering. The Technical Training Institute established in 1965, with the assistance from the Government of Federal Republic of Germany, offered technician courses in general courses in General Mechanics, Auto Mechanics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Drafting. In 1972, the Nepal Engineering Institute at Pulchowk and the Technical Training Institute at Thapathali were brought together under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University to constitute the Institute of Engineering. The Nepal Engineering Institute and the Technical Training Institute were renamed as Pulchowk campus and Thapathali Campus respectively. The technician programs in Electrical, Electronics, Refrigeration/Air-conditioning Engineering were started at Pulchowk campus, with the assistance from UNDP/ILO. The Architecture Technician program was started by the IOE. With the assistance of the World Bank and UK, later, the existing technician level courses were strengthened and a bachelor's degree level course in Civil Engineering was started. Similarly, with the assistance of the World Bank, the Swiss government, and the Canadian government, Bachelor's degree level courses in Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical engineering and Architecture were started in the Pulchowk campus. In 1998 IOE started a bachelor's degree program in Computer Engineering. In 1996, the Pulchowk campus, with support from the Norwegian government, started M.Sc. courses in Urban Planning, Structural Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Engineering. Pulchok Campus started M.Sc. courses in Renewable Energy and Geothermal Engineering, Information and Communication and Power Systems Engineering effective from December 2001. The diploma level programs at the Pulchowk Campus have been transferred to other three IOE campuses. The Pashchimanchal Campus in Pokhara of IOE became operational from 1987, with the assistance from the World Bank and UNDP/ILO. Initially trades and technician courses were offered. It offered diploma level courses in Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Automobile and Mechanical Engineering up to 2012. In 1999 a bachelor's degree program in Civil Engineering was started. Now it offers bachelor's degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics \u0026 Communication, Computer, and Geomatics Engineering (started in 2012). Pashchimanchal Campus has also introduced Masters level in three different fields which are MSc in Infrastructure and Management, MSc in Electrical Distributed Generations and MSc in Communication and Knowledge. The Thapathali Campus offers bachelor's degree programs in Civil Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and in B.Architecture. It offered diploma level courses in Civil, Computer, Electronics and Communication, Mechanical and Automobile, and Architecture up to 2012. The Purwanchal Campus in Dharan, which began operating from 1984, was built with the financial assistance from Asian Development Bank and technical assistance from the UK. This campus offered courses at the trade and technician levels. And it offered diploma level courses in the Civil, Electrical, Mechanical and Refrigeration/Air- conditioning Engineering up to 2012. In 2000 a bachelor's degree program in Agricultural Engineering was started. Now it offers bachelor's degree in Engineering (BE) in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Electronics \u0026 Communication, Computer, and Architecture (B.Arch). Chitwan Engineering Campus was established in Rampur, Bharatpur in collaboration with Bharatpur Metropolitan City. The campus offers bachelor's course in Architecture at present. ==Organizational structure== In the light of objectives stated, Institute of Engineering is dedicated to producing engineering leaders for future generations who are altruistic, capable of independent learning and thinking, and eager to contribute the society. There are colleges and centres dedicated to this cause and running under Institute of Engineering: ===Constituent campuses=== Pulchowk Campus is the central campus of the Institute of Engineering in the heart of Lalitpur metropolitan city.

  "content": "A Honda Super Cub engine. The most popular motorcycle in history, with over 100 million produced. A motorcycle engine is an engine that powers a motorcycle. Motorcycle engines are typically two-stroke or four-stroke internal combustion engines, but other engine types, such as Wankels and electric motors, have been used. Although some mopeds, such as the VéloSoleX, had friction drive to the front tire, a motorcycle engine normally drives the rear wheel, power being sent to the driven wheel by belt, chain or shaft. Historically, some 2,000 units of the Megola were produced between 1921–1925 with front wheel drive,Revoluntionary eccentricities: A survey of the rotary engine over the years. Motorcycle Sport, April 1983, pp.166-171, p.188 Accessed February 2019 and the modern Rokon, an all terrain motorcycle with both wheels driven, has been produced since 1960.About Rokon rokon.com Retrieved February 2019 Most engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy tourers, for example the Honda GL1600, and sidecar motorcycles, such as the Ural. The rider changes gears on most motorcycles using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers. More recently, some have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes. Outside the United States, engine capacities typically ranged from about 50 cc to 650 cc; but in Europe since 1968 motorcycles with larger capacities have become common, ranging as high as the Triumph Rocket 3's engine. In the United States, V-twin engined-motorcycles with capacities of 850 cc or more have been the norm since the 1920s. ==History== Michaux-Perreaux, Roper and other steam cycles were rescued from obscurity, and the stories of the early steam cycle experiments were rediscovered. There were no steam motorcycles in 1818, but there soon would be. The first motorcycles were powered by steam engines. The earliest example is the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede of 1868. This was followed by the American Roper steam velocipede of 1869, and a number of other steam powered two and three wheelers, manufactured and sold to the public on through the early 20th century. Using frames based both on the earlier boneshaker and the later—and in many ways completely modern—safety bicycle design, these early steam motorcycles experimented with a variety of engine placement strategies, as well as transmission and options. While today nearly every motorcycle has its engine in the center of the frame; this became standard only around 1900-1910 after nearly every possible engine location was tried. The origins of the scooter engine arrangement (including the shaft drive) can be traced back to the 19th century but the current layout became generally adopted after the Great War. The modern equivalent became universally popular in the 1950s and remains much the same today. The Otto cycle gasoline internal combustion engine was first used on an experimental two-wheeler created by Gottlieb Daimler to test the practicality of such an engine in a vehicle. This motorcycle, the Daimler Reitwagen, is credited as the world's first motorcycle by many authorities, partially on the assumption that a motorcycle is defined not as any two-wheel motor vehicle, but a two- wheel internal combustion engine motor vehicle. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines the word motorcycle this way.| The steam cycles were also simply neglected and forgotten by many historians, even as the Michaux- Perreaux waited forty years on display in the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. In recent years, a surge in interest in clean energy has put many new electric powered two wheelers on the market, and they are registered as motorcycles or scooters, without the type of powerplant being an issue. Diesel motorcycles were also experimented with briefly in the 20th century, and are again the subject of interest due to fuel economy and the needs of military logistics. The USMC has ordered a new diesel motorcycle, the M1030 M1, that can use the same fuel, JP-8, as the rest of their armored vehicles, aircraft, cars and trucks. The overwhelming majority of the motorcycles produced and used in the world today have small displacement air-cooled single-cylinder engines, both two- and four-strokes. In the wealthier parts of the world, Europe and Japan, larger displacements and multiple cylinders are common alongside small- displacement bikes required by various licensing and rider experience requirements, and so a very diverse range of sizes, cylinder numbers, configurations, and cooling systems are seen on the road. Many developed countries have graduated licensing, where a rider is licensed for a period of time to ride only smaller-displacement motorcycles before being allowed to ride larger ones. In the United States, there are no such mandates, and so the mix is skewed even further to the largest displacements, consumer demand drives manufacturers to offer their largest motorcycles to that country, and to export far fewer sub- models to the American market. ==Types== Almost all production motorcycles have gasoline internal combustion engines. Both four- stroke and two-stroke engines are used, but strict emission laws have led to far fewer two-strokes. A few have used Wankel rotary engines, but no Wankel bikes are currently in production. Motorcycle engines can be air cooled or liquid cooled, and optionally include oil cooling as well. Some scooters use batteries and an electric motor. The 2009 TT races introduced a new category 'TTX' (renamed as TT Zero) for electric bikes using fuel-cells or batteries. Motorcycle engines can be mounted transversely; with the crankshaft aligned perpendicular to the frame or longitudinally, with the crankshaft parallel to the frame. Motorcycles with transversely mounted engines are more suited to have chain or belt final-drive. Motorcycles with longitudinally mounted engines are more suited for shaft final-drive. Motor scooters often have the engine as part of the rear suspension, so the engine is not fixed rigidly to the main frame. Instead, the combined engine-transmission-swingarm assembly is pivoted to follow the road surface and is part of the \"unsprung weight\". The chain final-drive of scooters runs in an oil-bath within the engine casings. \"Step-through\" motorcycles may have a rigidly fixed engine, or may have a scooter-type arrangement. ==Two-stroke and four-stroke== Two-stroke engines have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and produce twice the number of power strokes per revolution. Fuel economy is better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in four-stroke engines. Nevertheless, two-strokes have been largely replaced on motorcycles in developed nations due to their environmental disadvantages. Cylinder lubrication is necessarily total-loss and this inevitably leads to a smokey exhaust, particularly on wide throttle openings. Two-stroke-engined motorcycles continue to be made in large numbers, but mostly off-road motocross low-power mopeds, small scooters and step-through underbones where they still compete strongly with four-strokes (including the highest-selling motorcycle of all time, the 50 cc Honda Super Cub). The major markets of two- stroke motorcycles are in dirt bikes and developing nations. ==Cylinder heads (four-stroke)== Cylinder head design has a significant effect on the efficiency of combustion, and hence the power output of the engine. The head may be flat, in which case the combustion chamber resides within the cylinder and/or a depression in the piston crown, but usually a \"dome\" within the cylinder head provides most of the combustion volume. Motorcycles use poppet valves in a range of designs: side valve, overhead valve (OHV) with pushrod operation, overhead cam (SOHC), and double overhead cam (DOHC). A cylinder with desmodromic valves may have three or even four camshafts. An OHC or DOHC cylinder head will have at least two valves per cylinder (1 inlet and 1 exhaust), but multi-valve engines may have three (2 inlet and 1 exhaust), or four (2 inlet and 2 exhaust), or even five (3 inlet and 2 exhaust). Cylinder heads are the hottest part of the engine and require adequate cooling, typically air cooling, oil cooling or liquid cooling. Some motorcycles such as Harley-Davidsons, Moto Guzzis and BMWs become identifiable by their cylinder- head types, namely airhead, panhead, oilhead, and even knucklehead. The Ducati desmos head enables higher rpm to be achieved without detrimental valve float also known as valve bounce. ==Valve control in four-strokes== In a side-valve engine, the valves are operated from the \"underhead\" cam without special valve gear. Overhead valve (OHV) engines have valves operated by pushrods. Single- and double-overhead camshaft (SOHC and DOHC, respectively) engines have overhead camshafts typically operated by chain, belt, gear train or bevel gear drive. The earliest motorcycle engines had exhaust valves operated in the same way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The intake valve was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the intake valve arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and rocker arm to operate the intake valve. Honda equipped the CBR400F with REV, described as \"revolution responding type valve pausing mechanism\", in 1983. This system enabled switching over the number of valve operations per cylinder between low and medium speed revolution range and high speed revolution range. In 2002, Honda introduced HYPER VTEC in the VFR800 Interceptor. In 2006, Kawasaki introduced VVT in the Concours 14. ==Unit construction== Engines and gearboxes were originally separate items, the gearbox being driven by a \"primary chain\". Later designs combined the two elements into a single \"unit construction\". Some manufacturers, such as Norton and Enfield continued with \"pre-unit\" construction until recently, and Harley- Davidson still makes pre-unit engines today. In the early 1960s, BSA introduced new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650 cc parallel twins to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. Triumph modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650 cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500 cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by Lucas to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, was a significant factor in forcing the redesign. Traditionally, engines and gearboxes had separate lubrication systems with different grades of oil; but modern practice is to use the same oil for both. ==Cylinders and configuration== The majority of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; and all these may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes tend to have more cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50 cc to 660 cc, twins from 175 cc to 1,800 cc, triples from 380 cc to 2,300 cc, and so on. ===Single=== 1960 BSA Gold Star Single-cylinder engines ( \"singles\" or \"thumpers\") have the cylinder vertical, inclined or horizontal, the last type most common in step-through motorcycles. Single-cylinder engines require both a larger flywheel and a heavier-duty gearbox than multicylinder engines. Small singles are cheap to build and maintain and are suitable as cheap utility motorcycles. Until the mid-1960s, road-racing machines, like the UK's Matchless, AJS and Norton, tended to be large singles, but since then multicylinder racers have become the norm. Off-road and smaller dual-sport bikes tend to use single-cylinder engines. The simplicity of these engines, often relying on a single carburetor, make them relatively easy to maintain and repair in remote locations with few tools. Compared to lightweight off- road singles, the modern category of heavier off-road adventure bikes tend to forgo such simplicity, and instead have larger and more powerful parallel- twin, flat-twin, or V-twin engines. ===Twin=== ;Straight-twin 1962 Honda CB77 Superhawk twin engine. Starting with Edward Turner's 1937 Triumph Speed Twin design, and until the mid-1970s, the parallel-twin was the most common British motorcycle type. Parallel-twins are usually mounted transversely, with the cylinders side by side above the crankshaft, and with exhaust pipes at the front, in the cool airstream. Longitudinal, or inline, twins include the 500 cc Sunbeam S7 and S8. There are three crankshaft configurations for this engine: 360°, 180°, and the newer 270°. Parallel twins usually have only two main bearings. ;V-twin Harley-Davidson Sportster V-twin In a V-twin engine the cylinders form a \"V\" around the crankshaft. A Vee-angle of 90°, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect primary and secondary balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42° (Indian), 45° (Harley- Davidson), 52° Honda, and 60° (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods so that the cylinders are slightly offset, but a variation is to have a single crankpin with \"fork \u0026 blade\" con- rods, to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90° V-twins may have offset crankpins to try to reduce vibration. V-twins may be mounted either longitudinally with the cylinders protruding either side, like the Honda CX500 and Moto Guzzi, or transversely, such as Harley-Davidson, Ducati, or Aprilia. V-twin Design Engineering (Retrieved 26 November 2006) Transverse V-twins can raise difficulties in cooling the aft cylinder, and in siting the airbox, battery, aft carburetor, and aft exhaust pipe. ;Flat-twin BMW's opposed twin on a 1954 R68 In a flat-twin, or boxer, engine the cylinders are horizontally opposed. The boxer has perfect primary balance, and only a small rocking couple, and unlike a V-twin, regular firing intervals, producing very low vibration levels, without the use of counterbalance shafts. They are usually mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft, with the cylinders protruding into the airstream, so that a flat-twin can satisfactorily be air-cooled. Flat-twins are made by BMW and Ural and historically by Douglas, Marusho, and Hoffmann, among others. The longitudinal mounting makes the flat twin highly suitable for shaft final drive. Some early motorcycles used transverse-crank flat twin engines, especially Douglas motorcycles before World War II. ;Tandem twin The Tandem Twin where the cylinders are longitudinal, and have two cranks geared together such as Kawasaki's KR250 road bike and KR250 and KR350 GP Bikes. A tandem twin is effectively a pair of geared singles, and is to be distinguished from an inline twin such as the Sunbeam S7. Tandem twins are suitable primarily for two-stroke racers. ===Triple=== ;Inline triple Triumph Rocket III inline-3 Three-cylinder engines, a.k.a. triples, are normally mounted transversely. The British Hinckley Triumph factory has specialized in transverse triples, although their 2,300 cc Rocket III has its engine mounted longitudinally. Other examples are the Benelli' \"Tre\"and the Yamaha XS750. The Italian firm Laverda made a few 1,000 cc and 1,200 cc triples. Some Laverda Triples had 120° cranks, while some had 180° cranks, essentially three- quarters of a four. BMW made the K75 longitudinally mounted 750 cc triple with the cylinders parallel to the ground. Meriden Triumph developed the 750 cc Trident, from which BSA \"badge-engineered\" the Rocket-3. Some triples were two-strokes. The Kawasaki triples were produced with capacities of 250, 350, 400, 500, and 750 cc in the 1970s, while Suzuki produced 380, 550, and 750 triples, the last being water-cooled. Motobecane made 350 cc and fuel-injected 500 cc triples with 3 into 4 pipes in the early seventies. Honda produced the water-cooled V-3 two-strokes MVX250 and NS400. There have been various race bike triples such as Kawasaki KR750, Suzuki TR750 transverse 3s, and Proton/Modenas KR3, Honda NS500 V-3s. ===Four=== Four-cylinder engines are most commonly found in a transverse-mounted inline four layout, although some are longitudinal, as in the earlier BMW K100. V-4 and boxer designs, as in the earlier Honda Gold Wing, have been produced. One of the more unusual designs was the Ariel Square Four, effectively two parallel-twin engines one in front of the other in a common crankcase — it had remarkably little vibration due to the contra-rotating crankshafts. ;Inline four Honda CB750 transverse inline-4 Production of four cylinder motorcycles began with the FN Four in 1905. The FN had its engine in line with the frame; this layout would be copied by manufacturers in Europe and the United States before World War II. In the United States, inline fours made by Henderson and Indian were bought by enthusiasts and by police departments, the latter using them as pursuit motorcycles. The first across-the-frame 4-cylinder motorcycle was the racer 1939 Gilera 500 Rondine, it also had double-over-head camshafts, forced- inducting supercharger and also water-cooled. Since the advent of the Honda CB750 straight-four engine, straight-fours have dominated the non-cruiser street motorcycle segments. The German manufacturer Münch based their motorcycles on four-cylinder car engines. For example, the Mammut 2000 has a 2.0l with a turbo and cylinder heads by Cosworth. ;Flat four The Honda GL1000 flat-four A flat-4 or horizontally opposed-4 is a flat engine with four cylinders arranged horizontally in two banks of two cylinders on each side of a central crankcase. The pistons are usually mounted on the crankshaft such that opposing pistons move back and forth in opposite directions at the same time, somewhat like a boxing competitor punching their gloves together before a fight, which has led to it being referred to as a boxer engine. The configuration results in inherently good balance of the reciprocating parts, a low centre of gravity, and a very short engine length. ;V4 Honda VFR1200F engine with dual clutch transmission. Honda uses V4 engines in the ST series and VFR series. As for two-stroke engines, there were four cylinders in the smaller classes such as Kawasaki's 125 cc KR3 square 4 and Yamaha's 250 cc RD500 V4 (RZ 500 in the US). Yamaha later raced transverse four TZ500/700/750's and virtually all the bikes in the last decade of the two- stroke GP500 era were fours, first squares then Vs, by Honda, Kawasaki, Cagiva, Suzuki, Yamaha. Kawasaki also experimented with a trapezoidal four the 602S. Yamaha made the V4 RD500LC, and Suzuki the RG400 and RG500 square four road bikes. ;Square four A square four is a U engine with two cylinders on each side. This configuration was used on the Ariel Square Four motorcycle from 1931 to 1959. This design was revived as a two-stroke version on some racing Suzuki models, and their subsequent road-going version the RG500. Although some racing success was achieved, the road bikes didn't sell in great numbers, and the design was phased out in favor of in-line, four-stroke designs, as at the time two-stroke engines were quickly being superseded by more economical, reliable, and emissions-friendly four-strokes. ===Five=== ;V5 Honda V5 MotoGP engine Honda has produced five-cylinder engines for racing, the RC211V 990 cc V5. No V5 engines are currently available in commercial production motorcycles. Just prior to their collapse, BSA planned a modular family of bike engines based around a 200 cc single. The range was to include the single, a 400 cc twin, a 600 cc triple and a 1000 cc V5. None of these motorcycles reached production.\"Bike\" magazine February? 1973 ===Six=== ;Inline six Benelli Sei inline-6 The 1,047 cc Honda CBX was produced from 1978 to 1982. The 1,300 cc Kawasaki KZ1300 was produced from 1979 to 1989. Benelli made the 750 cc and 900 cc the Sei from 1972 to 1978. Honda made a 250 cc straight-six GP bike. The BMW K1600GT and K1600GTL, which were launched in 2011, have a transverse-mounted 1,649 cc engine. ;Flat 6 Honda Valkyrie flat-6 The six-cylinder engine is currently used by Honda in the Gold Wing, and had previously been used in the Valkyrie and the Rune, both of which were cruiser developments of the Gold Wing. ===V8=== Moto Guzzi V8 Galbusera built a V8 in 1938, and Moto Guzzi experimented over a period of two years with its dual- overhead-cam 500 cc V8, the Otto Cilindri, in the 1950s. Some custom and one- off motorcycles use more than six cylinders. For example, the Boss Hoss motorcycle uses (5,700 cc, 6,000 cc and 8,200 cc) Chevrolet V-8 crate motors. In 2003 Daimler-Chrysler manufactured a limited number of Tomahawk concept vehicles with a Dodge Viper V-10 engine. Australian company Drysdale have built short runs of 750 cc V8 superbikes and 1L V8 roadgoing motorcycles, both with engines specifically developed for the purpose. No major motorcycle manufacturer has used eight or more cylinders, although Honda made the 'almost' V8 oval-piston NR750 road bike and NR500 GP bike, having eight connecting rods. Morbidelli has shown two V8 prototype road bikes that were not produced. ===Other types=== Hercules Wankel 2000. ;Wankel rotary Wankel engines produce high power outputs for their size and weight, and several attempts were made to produce Wankel powered motorcycles in the 1970s. Yamaha and Kawasaki exhibited Wankel-powered motorcycles in 1972, but neither company manufactured one. German manufacturer Hercules, a member of the Sachs- controlled Zweirad Union, produced their single-rotor W2000 from 1974 to 1977. Suzuki produced their single-rotor RE5 from 1975 to 1976. Van Veen built 38 OCR1000 motorcycles with twin-rotor Comotor engines between 1978 and 1981. BSA experimented with Wankel engines before they ended production in the 1970s. These experiments later led to Wankel-engined Norton motorcycles in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Classic, the Commander, the fleet-only Interpol 2, and the F1. Steve Hislop won the 1992 Senior TT on a Wankel-powered Norton. ;Oval pistons The 8 valve per cylinder, two connecting rod per piston, oval piston Honda NR engine. Honda NR ;Rotary engines Megola, Killinger and Freund Motorcycle ;Turbine engines *MTT Turbine Superbike (turboshaft) *Jet Reaction afterburning turbojet Other jet engine motorcycle prototypes exist, but never have been commercialized. ;Rocket Several rocket-powered motorcycles have been built, including: *Fritz von Opel's 1928 \"Monster\" rocket bike *Skycycle X-2 rocket developed for Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon jump attempt *Eric Teboul's rocket-powered dragbike that set the world record at Santa Pod Raceway in 2009 ==Electric== ==Diesel== Only very small numbers of diesel engined motorcycles have ever been built. The improved fuel efficiency is offset by the increased weight, reduced acceleration and potential difficulty of starting, at least in colder climates. Enfield India built a few from 1965 onwards but is no longer doing so. In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced their first diesel-powered motorcycle, its Track T-800CDI, using an 800 cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. Several armies are moving to an all-diesel engine fleet to reduce the fire risks of gasoline and the need to provide two different fuels. This includes their dispatch riders as well, encouraging the market for diesel motorcycles. Interest in biofuels is also likely to encourage future developments for small Diesels. Diesels are also available in both two- and four-stroke versions. ==Engine cooling== ===Liquid=== Liquid-cooled motorcycles have a radiator, similar to the radiator on a car, which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinders when the engine is running. While most off-road motorcycles have no radiator fan and rely on air flowing over the radiators from the forward motion of the motorcycle, many road motorcycles have a small fan attached to the radiator which is controlled by a thermostat. Some off-road motorcycles are liquid-cooled, and anti-dirt protection is attached to the radiator. The cooling effect of this fan is enough to prevent the engine overheating in most conditions, so liquid-cooled bikes are safe to use in a city, where traffic may frequently be at a standstill. Emissions regulations and the market demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to liquid-cooling for most motorcycles. Even Harley-Davidson, a strong advocate of air-cooled motors, has recently added water cooling to the heads of their V-twin motors in their large touring models, with the radiators being hidden in the lower leg fairings. The Harley-Davidson Street 500, Street 750, and two V-Rod models have 60° V-twins that are fully water cooled, as opposed to the traditional air-cooled 45° V-twins. ===Air=== Most air-cooled motorcycles take advantage of air blowing past the cylinder and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. Some models, mostly scooters, are equipped with fans that force the air to go past the cylinder block, which solves the problem of city driving. The cylinders on air-cooled bikes are designed with fin heat sinks to aid in this process. Air- cooled bikes are cheaper, simpler and lighter than their water-cooled counterparts. ===Oil=== The BMW R1150GS has an oil cooler below the headlights and fins for air cooling on the cylinders Some manufacturers use a hybrid cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case and a small radiator. Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name \"oil-cooling.\" Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the R1150GS, use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively. ==Other components== ===Fuel Injection=== Fuel injection and computer engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and are increasingly being incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker points, and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems at about the same time. ===Turbo and Superchargers=== Superchargers, or blowers, were common in the GPs, until they were banned. The first supercharger on a production motorcycle was the 2015 Kawasaki Ninja H2 and H2R. The big four made a turbocharged bike, and Honda made two, mainly as an exercise in technical expertise and later discontinued them for more conventional methods. Bolt-on superchargers are available for street bikes and are essential for performance applications such as drag bikes and land speed record streamliners. Most sports bikes now use a ram-air induction system where as road speed increases, more air is forced through ducts in the fairing to pressurize the airbox. The first on a production motorcycle was the 1990 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11. Not to be confused with the original Ram-Air system where an air scoop/cowl was fitted to the top of the cylinder heads of Suzuki two-stroke engines to aid cooling. ==See also== *List of motorcycles by type of engine *Motorcycle motor powered car *List of motorized trikes *Aircraft engine ==References== Category:Engine technology ",

  "content": "Neural engineering (also known as neuroengineering) is a discipline within biomedical engineering that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs (Hetling, 2008). == Overview == The field of neural engineering draws on the fields of computational neuroscience, experimental neuroscience, clinical neurology, electrical engineering and signal processing of living neural tissue, and encompasses elements from robotics, cybernetics, computer engineering, neural tissue engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology. Prominent goals in the field include restoration and augmentation of human function via direct interactions between the nervous system and artificial devices. Much current research is focused on understanding the coding and processing of information in the sensory and motor systems, quantifying how this processing is altered in the pathological state, and how it can be manipulated through interactions with artificial devices including brain- computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics. Other research concentrates more on investigation by experimentation, including the use of neural implants connected with external technology. Neurohydrodynamics is a division of neural engineering that focuses on hydrodynamics of the neurological system. == History == As neural engineering is a relatively new field, information and research relating to it is comparatively limited, although this is changing rapidly. The first journals specifically devoted to neural engineering, The Journal of Neural Engineering and The Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation both emerged in 2004. International conferences on neural engineering have been held by the IEEE since 2003, from 29 April until 2 May 2009 in Antalya, Turkey 4th Conference on Neural Engineering, the 5th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering in April/May 2011 in Cancún, Mexico, and the 6th conference in San Diego, California in November 2013. The 7th conference was held in April 2015 in Montpellier. The 8th conference was held in May 2017 in Shanghai. == Fundamentals == The fundamentals behind neuroengineering involve the relationship of neurons, neural networks, and nervous system functions to quantifiable models to aid the development of devices that could interpret and control signals and produce purposeful responses. === Neuroscience === Messages that the body uses to influence thoughts, senses, movements, and survival are directed by nerve impulses transmitted across brain tissue and to the rest of the body. Neurons are the basic functional unit of the nervous system and are highly specialized cells that are capable of sending these signals that operate high and low level functions needed for survival and quality of life. Neurons have special electro-chemical properties that allow them to process information and then transmit that information to other cells. Neuronal activity is dependent upon neural membrane potential and the changes that occur along and across it. A constant voltage, known as the membrane potential, is normally maintained by certain concentrations of specific ions across neuronal membranes. Disruptions or variations in this voltage create an imbalance, or polarization, across the membrane. Depolarization of the membrane past its threshold potential generates an action potential, which is the main source of signal transmission, known as neurotransmission of the nervous system. An action potential results in a cascade of ion flux down and across an axonal membrane, creating an effective voltage spike train or \"electrical signal\" which can transmit further electrical changes in other cells. Signals can be generated by electrical, chemical, magnetic, optical, and other forms of stimuli that influence the flow of charges, and thus voltage levels across neural membranes (He 2005). === Engineering === Engineers employ quantitative tools that can be used for understanding and interacting with complex neural systems. Methods of studying and generating chemical, electrical, magnetic, and optical signals responsible for extracellular field potentials and synaptic transmission in neural tissue aid researchers in the modulation of neural system activity (Babb et al. 2008). To understand properties of neural system activity, engineers use signal processing techniques and computational modeling (Eliasmith \u0026 Anderson 2003). To process these signals, neural engineers must translate the voltages across neural membranes into corresponding code, a process known as neural coding. Neural coding studies on how the brain encodes simple commands in the form of central pattern generators (CPGs), movement vectors, the cerebellar internal model, and somatotopic maps to understand movement and sensory phenomena. Decoding of these signals in the realm of neuroscience is the process by which neurons understand the voltages that have been transmitted to them. Transformations involve the mechanisms that signals of a certain form get interpreted and then translated into another form. Engineers look to mathematically model these transformations (Eliasmith \u0026 Anderson 2003). There are a variety of methods being used to record these voltage signals. These can be intracellular or extracellular. Extracellular methods involve single-unit recordings, extracellular field potentials, and amperometry; more recently, multielectrode arrays have been used to record and mimic signals. == Scope == === Neuromechanics === Neuromechanics is the coupling of neurobiology, biomechanics, sensation and perception, and robotics (Edwards 2010). Researchers are using advanced techniques and models to study the mechanical properties of neural tissues and their effects on the tissues' ability to withstand and generate force and movements as well as their vulnerability to traumatic loading (Laplaca \u0026 Prado 2010). This area of research focuses on translating the transformations of information among the neuromuscular and skeletal systems to develop functions and governing rules relating to operation and organization of these systems (Nishikawa et al. 2007). Neuromechanics can be simulated by connecting computational models of neural circuits to models of animal bodies situated in virtual physical worlds (Edwards 2010). Experimental analysis of biomechanics including the kinematics and dynamics of movements, the process and patterns of motor and sensory feedback during movement processes, and the circuit and synaptic organization of the brain responsible for motor control are all currently being researched to understand the complexity of animal movement. Dr. Michelle LaPlaca's lab at Georgia Institute of Technology is involved in the study of mechanical stretch of cell cultures, shear deformation of planar cell cultures, and shear deformation of 3D cell containing matrices. Understanding of these processes is followed by development of functioning models capable of characterizing these systems under closed loop conditions with specially defined parameters. The study of neuromechanics is aimed at improving treatments for physiological health problems which includes optimization of prostheses design, restoration of movement post injury, and design and control of mobile robots. By studying structures in 3D hydrogels, researchers can identify new models of nerve cell mechanoproperties. For example, LaPlaca et al. developed a new model showing that strain may play a role in cell culture (LaPlaca et al. 2005). === Neuromodulation === Neuromodulation aims to treat disease or injury by employing medical device technologies that would enhance or suppress activity of the nervous system with the delivery of pharmaceutical agents, electrical signals, or other forms of energy stimulus to re-establish balance in impaired regions of the brain. Researchers in this field face the challenge of linking advances in understanding neural signals to advancements in technologies delivering and analyzing these signals with increased sensitivity, biocompatibility, and viability in closed loops schemes in the brain such that new treatments and clinical applications can be created to treat those suffering from neural damage of various kinds.Potter S. 2012. NeuroEngineering: Neuroscience - Applied. In TEDxGeorgiaTech: TEDx Neuromodulator devices can correct nervous system dysfunction related to Parkinson's disease, dystonia, tremor, Tourette's, chronic pain, OCD, severe depression, and eventually epilepsy. Neuromodulation is appealing as treatment for varying defects because it focuses in on treating highly specific regions of the brain only, contrasting that of systemic treatments that can have side effects on the body. Neuromodulator stimulators such as microelectrode arrays can stimulate and record brain function and with further improvements are meant to become adjustable and responsive delivery devices for drugs and other stimuli. === Neural regrowth and repair === Neural engineering and rehabilitation applies neuroscience and engineering to investigating peripheral and central nervous system function and to finding clinical solutions to problems created by brain damage or malfunction. Engineering applied to neuroregeneration focuses on engineering devices and materials that facilitate the growth of neurons for specific applications such as the regeneration of peripheral nerve injury, the regeneration of the spinal cord tissue for spinal cord injury, and the regeneration of retinal tissue. Genetic engineering and tissue engineering are areas developing scaffolds for spinal cord to regrow across thus helping neurological problems (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). == Research and applications == Research focused on neural engineering utilizes devices to study how the nervous system functions and malfunctions (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). === Neural imaging === Neuroimaging techniques are used to investigate the activity of neural networks, as well as the structure and function of the brain. Neuroimaging technologies include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and computed axial tomography (CAT) scans. Functional neuroimaging studies are interested in which areas of the brain perform specific tasks. fMRI measures hemodynamic activity that is closely linked to neural activity. It probes the brain by tuning the brain scanner to a certain wavelength to see which part of the brain are activated doing different tasks by seeing what lights up doing different things. PET, CT scanners, and electroencephalography (EEG) are currently being improved and used for similar purposes. === Neural networks === Scientists can use experimental observations of neuronal systems and theoretical and computational models of these systems to create Neural networks with the hopes of modeling neural systems in as realistic a manner as possible. Neural networks can be used for analyses to help design further neurotechnological devices. Specifically, researchers handle analytical or finite element modeling to determine nervous system control of movements and apply these techniques to help patients with brain injuries or disorders. Artificial neural networks can be built from theoretical and computational models and implemented on computers from theoretically devices equations or experimental results of observed behavior of neuronal systems. Models might represent ion concentration dynamics, channel kinetics, synaptic transmission, single neuron computation, oxygen metabolism, or application of dynamic system theory (LaPlaca et al. 2005). Liquid-based template assembly was used to engineer 3D neural networks from neuron-seeded microcarrier beads. === Neural interfaces === Neural interfaces are a major element used for studying neural systems and enhancing or replacing neuronal function with engineered devices. Engineers are challenged with developing electrodes that can selectively record from associated electronic circuits to collect information about the nervous system activity and to stimulate specified regions of neural tissue to restore function or sensation of that tissue (Cullen et al. 2011). The materials used for these devices must match the mechanical properties of neural tissue in which they are placed and the damage must be assessed. Neural interfacing involves temporary regeneration of biomaterial scaffolds or chronic electrodes and must manage the body's response to foreign materials. Microelectrode arrays are recent advances that can be used to study neural networks (Cullen \u0026 Pfister 2011). Optical neural interfaces involve optical recordings and optogenetics stimulation that makes brain cells light sensitive. Fiber optics can be implanted in the brain to stimulate and record this photon activity instead of electrodes. Two-photon excitation microscopy can study living neuronal networks and the communicatory events among neurons. ==== Brain computer interfaces ==== Brain computer interfaces seek to directly communicate with human nervous system to monitor and stimulate neural circuits as well as diagnose and treat intrinsic neurological dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation is a significant advance in this field that is especially effective in treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease with high frequency stimulation of neural tissue to suppress tremors (Lega et al. 2011). ==== Microsystems ==== Neural microsystems can be developed to interpret and deliver electrical, chemical, magnetic, and optical signals to neural tissue. They can detect variations in membrane potential and measure electrical properties such as spike population, amplitude, or rate by using electrodes, or by assessment of chemical concentrations, fluorescence light intensity, or magnetic field potential. The goal of these systems is to deliver signals that would influence neuronal tissue potential and thus stimulate the brain tissue to evoke a desired response (He 2005). ===== Microelectrode arrays ===== Microelectrode arrays are specific tools used to detect the sharp changes in voltage in the extracellular environments that occur from propagation of an action potential down an axon. Dr. Mark Allen and Dr. LaPlaca have microfabricated 3D electrodes out of cytocompatible materials such as SU-8 and SLA polymers which have led to the development of in vitro and in vivo microelectrode systems with the characteristics of high compliance and flexibility to minimize tissue disruption. === Neural prostheses === Neuroprosthetics are devices capable of supplementing or replacing missing functions of the nervous system by stimulating the nervous system and recording its activity. Electrodes that measure firing of nerves can integrate with prosthetic devices and signal them to perform the function intended by the transmitted signal. Sensory prostheses use artificial sensors to replace neural input that might be missing from biological sources (He 2005). Engineers researching these devices are charged with providing a chronic, safe, artificial interface with neuronal tissue. Perhaps the most successful of these sensory prostheses is the cochlear implant which has restored hearing abilities to the deaf. Visual prosthesis for restoring visual capabilities of blind persons is still in more elementary stages of development. Motor prosthesics are devices involved with electrical stimulation of biological neural muscular system that can substitute for control mechanisms of the brain or spinal cord. Smart prostheses can be designed to replace missing limbs controlled by neural signals by transplanting nerves from the stump of an amputee to muscles. Sensory prosthetics provide sensory feedback by transforming mechanical stimuli from the periphery into encoded information accessible by the nervous system. Electrodes placed on the skin can interpret signals and then control the prosthetic limb. These prosthetics have been very successful. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a system aimed at restoring motor processes such as standing, walking, and hand grasp. === Neurorobotics === Neurorobotics is the study of how neural systems can be embodied and movements emulated in mechanical machines. Neurorobots are typically used to study motor control and locomotion, learning and memory selection, and value systems and action selection. By studying neurorobots in real-world environments, they are more easily observed and assessed to describe heuristics of robot function in terms of its embedded neural systems and the reactions of these systems to its environment (Krichmar 2008). For instance, making use of a computational model of epilectic spike-wave dynamics, it has been already proven the effectiveness of a method to simulate seizure abatement through a pseudospectral protocol. The computational model emulates the brain connectivity by using a magnetic imaging resonance from a patient suffering of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The method was able to generate stimuli able to lessen the seizures. === Neural tissue regeneration === Neural tissue regeneration, or neuroregeneration looks to restore function to those neurons that have been damaged in small injuries and larger injuries like those caused by traumatic brain injury. Functional restoration of damaged nerves involves re-establishment of a continuous pathway for regenerating axons to the site of innervation. Researchers like Dr. LaPlaca at Georgia Institute of Technology are looking to help find treatment for repair and regeneration after traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injuries by applying tissue engineering strategies. Dr. LaPlaca is looking into methods combining neural stem cells with an extracellular matrix protein based scaffold for minimally invasive delivery into the irregular shaped lesions that form after a traumatic insult. By studying the neural stem cells in vitro and exploring alternative cell sources, engineering novel biopolymers that could be utilized in a scaffold, and investigating cell or tissue engineered construct transplants in vivo in models of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, Dr. LaPlaca's lab aims to identify optimal strategies for nerve regeneration post injury. ==== Current approaches to clinical treatment ==== End to end surgical suture of damaged nerve ends can repair small gaps with autologous nerve grafts. For larger injuries, an autologous nerve graft that has been harvested from another site in the body might be used, though this process is time consuming, costly and requires two surgeries (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). Clinical treatment for CNS is minimally available and focuses mostly on reducing collateral damage caused by bone fragments near the site of injury or inflammation. After swelling surrounding injury lessens, patients undergo rehabilitation so that remaining nerves can be trained to compensate for the lack of nerve function in injured nerves. No treatment currently exists to restore nerve function of CNS nerves that have been damaged (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). ==== Engineering strategies for repair ==== Engineering strategies for the repair of spinal cord injury are focused on creating a friendly environment for nerve regeneration. Only PNS nerve damage has been clinically possible so far, but advances in research of genetic techniques and biomaterials demonstrate the potential for SC nerves to regenerate in permissible environments. ===== Grafts ===== Advantages of autologous tissue grafts are that they come from natural materials which have a high likelihood of biocompatibility while providing structural support to nerves that encourage cell adhesion and migration (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). Nonautologous tissue, acellular grafts, and extracellular matrix based materials are all options that may also provide ideal scaffolding for nerve regeneration. Some come from allogenic or xenogenic tissues that must be combined with immunosuppressants. while others include small intestinal submucosa and amniotic tissue grafts (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). Synthetic materials are attractive options because their physical and chemical properties can typically be controlled. A challenge that remains with synthetic materials is biocompatibility (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). Methylcellulose-based constructs have been shown to be a biocompatible option serving this purpose (Tate et al. 2001). AxoGen uses a cell graft technology AVANCE to mimic a human nerve. It has been shown to achieve meaningful recovery in 87 percent of patients with peripheral nerve injuries. ===== Nerve guidance channels ===== Nerve guidance channels, Nerve guidance conduit are innovative strategies focusing on larger defects that provide a conduit for sprouting axons directing growth and reducing growth inhibition from scar tissue. Nerve guidance channels must be readily formed into a conduit with the desired dimensions, sterilizable, tear resistant, and easy to handle and suture (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). Ideally they would degrade over time with nerve regeneration, be pliable, semipermeable, maintain their shape, and have a smooth inner wall that mimics that of a real nerve (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). ===== Biomolecular therapies ===== Highly controlled delivery systems are needed to promote neural regeneration. Neurotrophic factors can influence development, survival, outgrowth, and branching. Neurotrophins include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5). Other factors are ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF) and acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, bFGF) that promote a range of neural responses.(Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003) Fibronectin has also been shown to support nerve regeneration following TBI in rats (Tate et al. 2002). Other therapies are looking into regeneration of nerves by upregulating regeneration associated genes (RAGs), neuronal cytoskeletal components, and antiapoptosis factors. RAGs include GAP-43 and Cap-23, adhesion molecules such as L1 family, NCAM, and N-cadherin (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). There is also the potential for blocking inhibitory biomolecules in the CNS due to glial scarring. Some currently being studied are treatments with chondroitinase ABC and blocking NgR, ADP-ribose (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). ===== Delivery techniques ===== Delivery devices must be biocompatible and stable in vivo. Some examples include osmotic pumps, silicone reservoirs, polymer matrices, and microspheres. Gene therapy techniques have also been studied to provide long-term production of growth factors and could be delivered with viral or non-viral vectors such as lipoplexes. Cells are also effective delivery vehicles for ECM components, neurotrophic factors and cell adhesion molecules. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and stem cells as well as genetically modified cells have been used as transplants to support nerve regeneration (LaPlaca et al. 2005, Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003, Tate et al. 2002). ===== Advanced therapies ===== Advanced therapies combine complex guidance channels and multiple stimuli that focus on internal structures that mimic the nerve architecture containing internal matrices of longitudinally aligned fibers or channels. Fabrication of these structures can use a number of technologies: magnetic polymer fiber alignment, injection molding, phase separation, solid free-form fabrication, and ink jet polymer printing (Schmidt \u0026 Leach 2003). === Neural enhancement === Augmentation of human neural systems, or human enhancement using engineering techniques is another possible application of neuroengineering. Deep brain stimulation has already been shown to enhance memory recall as noted by patients currently using this treatment for neurological disorders. Brain stimulation techniques are postulated to be able to sculpt emotions and personalities as well as enhance motivation, reduce inhibitions, etc. as requested by the individual. Ethical issues with this sort of human augmentation are a new set of questions that neural engineers have to grapple with as these studies develop. == See also == * Brain-computer interface * Brain-reading * Cybernetics * Cyberware * Neuroprosthetics * Neurosecurity * Sensory substitution * Simulated reality * Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chips ==References== * * * * * Edwards DH. 2010.
