  "content": "Service Climate has been embedded in the research of social climate (see also: Social environment) which relates to the overall group influence of individuals who partake in certain within-group activities (i.e. Waiting staff). The group aspect of service climate has been compared to atmospheric climate in a way to illustrate its inner distinctive characteristics between different groups of individuals. The social environment has also been related to entrepreneurial leadership within business management and how organizing a group of people can be done to achieve a common goal. Evidence also leads to a rise in research beginning with early social experiments in the 1960s. \"Like meteorological or atmospheric climate, social climate is relatively distinctive across groups (as the Tropics differ from the Himalayas); is dynamic or changeable within groups (like the seasons); and can influence behavior (like an individual’s choice of clothing). Social climate research has grown considerably since White and Lippitt’s (1960) early experiments comparing democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire leadership in small groups of children. The concept and measurement of social climate have since been applied across widely diverse disciplines both within and outside the field of psychology.\" Social Climate Research. (2004). In The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science. Retrieved from Climate for service refers to employee perceptions of the practices, procedures, and behaviors that get rewarded, supported, and expected with regard to customer service and customer service quality. For example, to the extent that employees perceive that they are rewarded for delivering quality service, their organization's service climate will be stronger. Additionally, perceptions that customer service is important to management will also contribute to a strong service climate. \"A set of foundation issues that support employee work and service quality is conceptualized as a necessary but not sufficient cause of a climate for service, which in turn is proposed to be reflected in customer experiences.\"Schneider, Benjamin; White, Susan S.; Paul, Michelle C. (1998) Linking Service Climate and Customer Perceptions of Service Quality: Test of a Causal Model Journal of Applied Psychology Volume 83(2): 150–163 , additional text. Service climate is a collective and shared phenomenon. This climate is built in the light of organizational practices focused on customer service. The way boundary workers (employees with whom customers physically interact in the course of doing business with an organization) perceive their organizations' service climates are related to the service quality perceived by those organizations' customers.Schneider, B., \u0026 Bowen, D. (1995). Winning the service game. Boston: Harvard Business School Press ==Importance of the service climate== Research has shown that service quality is ultimately related to customer loyalty and retention and, eventually, to higher profits for the organization. \"This skepticism about the value of service quality makes it imperative that research be undertaken to address the quantification of the impact of customer satisfaction on observable financial measures, to place programs to improve customer satisfaction and service quality on an even footing with most other business programs that must justify themselves financially.\".Rust, Roland T., \u0026 Zahorik, Anthony J. (1993). Customer satisfaction, customer retention, and market share. Journal of Retailing, 69, 193–215 , additional text.Storbacka, J., Strandvik, T., \u0026 Gronroos, C. (1994). Managing customer relationship quality. International Journal of Service Industry Management, 5, 21–28 ==Antecedents of the service climate== The recent research had confirmed the previous findings regarding the positive relationship between organizational resources as an antecedent of service climate, and also showed that this relationship is fully mediated by engagement at the group level. Thus, at the work-unit level, engagement contributes to improve shared service climate among service units.Linking Organizational Resources and Work Engagement to Employee Performance and Customer Loyalty: The Mediation of Service Climate. Salanova, Marisa; Agut, Sonia; Peiró, José María Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol 90(6), Nov 2005, 1217-1227 , additional text. As well, the research shows that when employees working in work units perceive that the availability of organizational resources (i.e., training, autonomy and technology) remove obstacles at work, they feel more engaged in work, which in turn is related to a better climate for service. Working in an organization that facilitates work for the customers exerts a powerful influence on collective engagement (i.e., the members of the work unit feel more vigorous and persistent, dedicated and absorbed in their tasks). This in turn has a very positive impact on shared service climate perceptions. The relation between the service climate and customer loyalty seems to be reciprocal, since it was found that the greater is the service climate, the higher is the customer loyalty, (partially mediated by performance) and the higher is the customer loyalty, the greater is the service climate.(Schneider et al., 1998). ==References== Category:Customer service Category:Services marketing ",

  "content": "A singularity is a weather phenomenon likely to occur with reasonable regularity around a specific approximate calendar date,Barry R.G. \u0026 Chorley R.J. (1987), Atmosphere, Weather \u0026 Climate, 5th ed, Routledge, outside of more general seasonal weather patterns (e.g., that May Day is usually warmer than New Year's Day in northern locales). The existence of singularities is disputed, some considering them due to seeing patterns in noise and statistical artifacts from small samples. In North America, the most significant purported singularities are January thaw (warmer weather around January 25) and Indian summer (warmer weather in mid-autumn). More fanciful ones include the British tradition that rain on St. Swithun's Day (15 July) will be followed by forty days and nights of rain, and similar folk beliefs around groundhog day. ==Studies== Although folk tales such as St Swithun's Day generally have little credibility, some of these events have a more solid basis. Early scientific investigation involved the creation of calendars of singularities based on temperature and rainfall anomalies. Later and more successful work by Hubert Lamb of the Climatic Research Unit was based on air circulation patterns. Lamb's work analysed daily frequency of airflow categories between 1898 and 1947.Lamb H.H (1950) Types and spells of weather around the year in the British Isles: Annual trends, seasonal structure of the year, singularities.

(1955), Short periods of unseasonal warmth or cold in daily mean maximum temperatures at Bidston, Quart. J. Royal Met. Soc. 81/350, pp613-617 In the 1950s, E.G. Bowen suggested that some rainfall calendaricities might be explicable in terms of meteoric particles from cometary orbits acting as ice nuclei in terrestrial clouds; his theory received support from a number of sources However, such work has now fallen out of favour due to modern dynamic modelling techniques, although articles are still being written reflecting an interest in the topic. ==References== ==External links== * Singularities developed for the British Isles * Category:Climatology ",

  "content": "Jessica Hellmann is a Professor of Ecology and the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. She is recognized as \"one of the nation’s leading researchers on global change ecology and climate adaptation\". Hellmann was one of the first to identify that living with climate change is \"just as crucial to the future of humanity and Earth’s ecosystems as slowing and stopping greenhouse gas emissions\". Her lab uses mathematical models, genomic techniques to identify the impact of climate change on ecology and evolution. == Early life and education == Hellmann is originally from Indiana and Detroit, Michigan. Hellmann has said she chose a career in ecology after being inspired by space camp, her grandfather's farm and her father who worked as a mechanical engineer at General Motors. She completed a Bachelor's in Ecology at the University of Michigan in 1996. She holds a PhD in Biology from Stanford. Her doctoral advisor, and role model, was Paul R. Ehrlich. She was a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for International Security and Cooperation, where she argued that the environment was an important part of security. At Stanford University, she was part of the Leopold Leadership Program. Hellmann also worked as a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Zoology at the University of British Columbia. == Career == Hellmann joined the University of Notre Dame in 2003, where she served as a faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences. She received a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in 2006. She researched the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the distribution of insects and their host plants. She concentrated on the Garry oak species, and how they could spread in a future climate. She founded Notre Dame's undergraduate minor is sustainability. In 2011 she was awarded a Residential Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study. In 2012,she published the book \"Advancing Adaptation In the City of Chicago\". She delivered the 2012 Reilly Forum Lecture, \"Fixing the global commons: what humans can and should do to help nature live and thrive through climate change\". In 2013, Hellmann helped the Global Adaptation Institute relocate in the University of Notre Dame. In 2015, she became Research Director of the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN), which measures climate risks and readiness to adapt to climate risks for countries around the world. She was worried about being labelled a \"butterfly person\", as she studied them extensively as proxy for how climate change impacts insects in general. She was described as an \"influential voice surrounding climate adaptation and the environment\". In 2015, Hellmann joined the University of Minnesota as the director of the Institute on the Environment., where she delivered a keynote talk, \"Can we save biodiversity from climate change?\" She is also the Russell M. and Elizabeth M. Bennett Chair in Excellence in the University's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior. She published her second book, \"A Review Of The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives\" in 2016. She is co-chair of the University of Minnesota Water Council. She continues to collaborate with ND- GAIN as a core research member and mentors other ND-GAIN researchers. She has influenced governments and corporations, encouraging them to strategically invest in climate change adaptation. In 2013 and 2014 she co-wrote the National Climate Change Assessment. She is on the Board of Directors of the Great Plains Institute, the Science Advisory Council for the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the governing committee of the Natural Capital Planet. She has contributed to CNN, NPR, Fox News, The Telegraph and the Chicago Tribune. She writes for The Conversation (website). In 2017 she was announced as an American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Fellow. Hellman regularly contributes to the following scientific journals: Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, BioScience and PLOS ONE. She serves on the editorial board of the journal Evolutionary Applications and is an associate editor with both Conservation Biology and Elementa. She serves on committees for the Ecological Society of America, the College Board, and the National Academy of Sciences. == Selected works == The following are notable articles written by Hellman. * 2019: \"Select but diverse countries are reducing both climate vulnerability and CO2 emissions\" * 2018: \"Five financial incentives to revive the Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone and Mississippi Basin Soils\" * 2018: \"Climate-mediated hybrid zone movement revealed with genomics, museum collection, and simulation modeling\" * 2018: \"Comparison of human and non-human migration governance under climate change.\" * 2017: \"Patterns of divergence across the geographic and genomic landscape of a butterfly hybrid zone associated with a climatic gradient\" * 2017: \"Society is ready for a new kind of science–is academia?\" * 2016: \"Climate Change in the Urban Environment: Advancing, Measuring and Achieving Resiliency.\" * 2016: \"Green and cool roofs to mitigate urban heat island effects in Chicago metropolitan area: evaluation with a regional climate model\" * 2015: \"Insights from community ecology into the role of enemy release in causing invasion success: the importance of native enemy effects\" * 2013: \"Using assisted colonisation to conserve biodiversity and restore ecosystem function under climate change\" * 2011: \"Future human intervention in ecosystems and the critical role of evolutionary biology\" == References == Category:American ecologists Category:University of Minnesota faculty Category:University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women ecologists Category:American women scientists ",

  "content": "The formula for change provides a model to assess the relative strengths affecting the likely success of organisational change programs. The formula was created by David Gleicher while he was working at Arthur D. Little in the early 1960s,Cady, S.H., Jacobs, J., Koller, R., \u0026 Spalding, J. (2014). The change formula: Myth, legend, or lore. OD Practitioner, 46(3), 32–39. and refined by Kathie Dannemiller in the 1980s.Wheatley, M. J., Tannebaum, R., Yardley, P. Y., \u0026 Quade, K. (2003). Organization development at work: Conversations on the values, applications, and future of OD (pp. 62–64). San Francisco, CA: John Wiley \u0026 Sons. ==Gleicher (original) version: C = A × B × D \u003e X== The original formula, as created by Gleicher and published by Richard Beckhard (see below),Beckhard, R. (1975). Strategies for large system change. Sloan Management Review, 16(2), 43–55. is: :C = A × B × D \u003e X where: ; C : is change; ; A : is the status quo dissatisfaction; ; B : is a desired clear state; ; D : is practical steps to the desired state; ; X : is the cost of the change. ==Dannemiller version: C = D × V × F \u003e R== :C = D × V × F \u003e R Three factors must be present for meaningful organizational change to take place. These factors are: ; C : is change; ; D : Dissatisfaction with how things are now; ; V : Vision of what is possible; ; F : First concrete steps that can be taken towards the vision. If the product of these three factors is greater than ; R : Resistance, then change is possible. Because D, V, and F are multiplied, if any one is absent (zero) or low, then the product will be zero or low and therefore not capable of overcoming the resistance. To ensure a successful change it is necessary to use influence and strategic thinking in order to create vision and identify those crucial, early steps towards it. In addition, the organization must recognize and accept the dissatisfaction that exists by listening to the employee voice while sharing industry trends, leadership ideas, best practices and competitor analysis to identify the necessity for change. ==Attribution confusion== It is often inaccurately attributed to Richard Beckhard because he published the formula in both versions of his widely read book Organizational Transitions. In the original 1977 version, Beckhard and Harris gave full credit to Gleicher.Beckhard, R., \u0026 Harris, R.T. (1977). Organizational transitions: Managing complex change (1st ed.). Addison-Wesley series on organization development. Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley Publishing. In the second edition from 1987, they did not even mention Gleicher's name once in the entire book, but did present the equation as a formula for overcoming resistance.Beckhard, R., \u0026 Harris, R.T. (1987). Organizational transitions: Managing complex change (2nd ed.). Addison-Wesley series on organization development. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing. Elaine Dickson attributed the formula to Beckhard in 1971, via a National Training Laboratories Institute for Applied Behavioral Science professional OD training program (in Bethel, Massachusetts), in her 1982 book Say No, Say Yes to Change: Finding Growth Opportunities in Life's Changes (Broadman Press, p. 142). ==Popularization== It was Kathleen Dannemiller who dusted off the formula and simplified it, making it more accessible for consultants and managers. Dannemiller and Robert W. Jacobs first published the more common version of the formula in 1992.Dannemiller, K. D., \u0026 Jacobs, R. W. (1992). Changing the way organizations change: A revolution of common sense. The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 28(4), 480–498. Paula Griffin stated that Gleicher started it, Beckhard and Harris promoted it, but it really took off when Dannemiller changed the language to make it easier to remember and use. == Empirical research == Researchers have attempted to test the formula's effectiveness empirically. Čudanov et al. developed a quantitative measurement instrument, based on Beckhard and Harris's version of the formula, that can be utilized in change management practice. The instrument aims to support change readiness in all phases of the change management cycle, on the one hand, and to provide insights into change success factors, on the other. Post- implementation assessment can reveal key factors that cause change failure. The measurement instrument of Čudanov et al. is shown in the wikibook Handbook of Management Scales.See the following pages of the Handbook of Management Scales: * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Change success * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - The degree of dissatisfaction with the status quo * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Clarity and strength of vision of change * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Clarity of actions towards preferred future state * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Resistance to change ==See also== * Decisional balance sheet * Force-field analysis * Immunity to change ==References== Category:Change management Category:Business terms ",
