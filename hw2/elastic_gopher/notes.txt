TODO:
- Develop the search functionality for the CLI tool. -> We need to develop a way to elaborate inputs from CLI
- Develop the indexing functionality for the CLI tool.
- Develop the configuration management for the CLI tool in order to change settings like the type of output or the default endpoint to interact with.
- Develop an indexing functionality to reference of a folder full of documents and upload them with a certain structure.


What kind of CLI interactions do I want? Something like this?
elastic_gopher search "How to implement a binary search tree in Python"
elastic_gopher search --fields title,content "machine learning algorithms"


elastic_gopher index create <name_of_index> [mappings]
elastic_gopher index document add <name_of_index> <document>
elastic_gopher index document remove <name_of_index> <document_id>
elastic_gopher index delete <name_of_index>
